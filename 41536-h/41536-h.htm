<hr class="r15" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a><br />
<small>AT ANCHOR, INSIDE THE BAR.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Get busy here, Nick; now&rsquo;s your chance
to make a big score for a starter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful kind of you, George, to let me
out of my part of the work this afternoon, and
that&rsquo;s a fact. I appreciate it, too; because I
just want to beat Jimmy out in this thing the
worst kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! shucks! don&rsquo;t mention it, Nick. We&rsquo;re
all interested in your game, and you know it.
Besides, there goes your rival, Jimmy, right
now, in his little dinky boat, and with a wide
grin on his face. Jack&rsquo;s given him a holiday,
to celebrate the opening of the great fishing
contest. Get a move on, you slow-poke!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee! then he&rsquo;ll get a start on me. I <i>must</i>
hurry. Now, where in the dickens is that other
oar, George? Oh! here she is, tucked away
under the thwart. And can you tell me what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
I did with that mullet the cracker gentleman
gave me, to use for bait? Please help me get
started, George. Seems like everything wants
to go wrong at once!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you are, Nick. Got your tackle all
right, have you; and sure that life preserver is
in the boat? All ready? Then away you go;
but keep clear of the inlet, if the tide changes,
or you might get carried out to sea in that
eight-foot dinky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three minutes later, and Nick Longfellow&mdash;who
belied his name dreadfully, in that he
was short, and fat, and built pretty much after
the style of a full meal bag&mdash;was rowing
clumsily toward a likely spot, where he believed
he might do some successful fishing.</p>

<p>A trio of motor boats were anchored just
inside Mosquito Inlet, not far from the town
of New Smyrna on the east coast of Florida,
having come in that very afternoon, after making
the outside passage from the mouth of the
St. Johns River.</p>

<p>They might have entered at St. Augustine,
and taken the inside passage down to this
place, only that something was wrong with the
connecting canal that led to the Halifax River,
and it seemed unwise to take the chances of
being held up.</p>

<p>The boat from which Nick had put out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
his fishing excursion was a slender looking
craft, and evidently capable of making high
speed; but from the way she rolled whenever
any one aboard moved, it could be seen that
she must prove rather an uncomfortable home
on which to spend very much time. The name
painted in letters of gold on her bow was
<i>Wireless</i>; and her skipper, George Rollins,
took more or less pride in her accomplishments;
although, truth to tell, he spent much
of his time tinkering with her high-power engine,
that had a way of betraying his trust
when conditions made it most exasperating.</p>

<p>The boat from which the said Jimmy had
started was called the <i>Tramp</i>. Her lines were
not so fine as those of the hurry boat; but,
nevertheless, an experienced cruiser would
have picked her out as an ideal craft for combined
business and pleasure. Her skipper was
Jack Stormways, really the commodore of the
little fleet; and his crew consisted of Jimmy
Brannigan, a boy who sported many freckles,
a happy-go-lucky disposition, and a little of
the Irish brogue whenever he happened to remember
his descent from the old kings of Erin.</p>

<p>As to the third motor boat, it was a broad
beamed affair, that really looked like a pumpkin
seed on a large scale; or, as some of the
boys often called it, a &ldquo;tub.&rdquo; It was well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
named the <i>Comfort</i>, and its owner, Herbert
Dickson, content to take things easy and let
others do the hustling, never denied the claim
George was fond of making, that he could
draw circles around the &ldquo;Ark&rdquo; with his fast
one. The engine of the <i>Comfort</i> had never
failed to do its level best, which was limited to
some nine miles an hour.</p>

<p>Herb also had an assistant, a tall, lanky lad,
by name Josh Purdue. By rights he and Nick
should have exchanged places; but Josh had
had one experience on the dizzy speed boat,
and absolutely refused to try it again.</p>

<p>These lads belonged in a town far up toward
the sources of the mighty Mississippi River.
They would have been attending high school,
only that a fire had almost demolished the
buildings, and vacation season was enforced
until after New Year&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Owning these boats, and having had considerable
experience in making long trips, the
boys had, with the consent of their parents,
shipped the craft east to Philadelphia, and
some five weeks previously started down the
coast by the inside route.</p>

<p>And now they were starting on the second
half of the remarkable voyage, which they intended
would take them around the end of the
peninsula of Florida, among the keys that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
make this region the small boat cruiser&rsquo;s paradise,
and finally land them at New Orleans in
time to ship their boats north by steamboat.</p>

<p>Spending several days in Jacksonville, and
taking aboard supplies, before making a start,
Nick and Jimmy had fallen into quite a heated
dispute as to which of them could be called
the more expert fisherman.</p>

<p>Now, truth to tell, neither of the boys had
had very much experience in this line; but,
egged on by Josh and Herb, they had finally
entered upon a contest which was to last until
they reached New Orleans. Jack had solemnly
entered the conditions in his log book;
and the one who, during the duration of the
cruise, could catch and land unassisted the
heaviest fish of any description, was to be declared
the champion.</p>

<p>Eager to accomplish wonderful &ldquo;stunts,&rdquo;
the two boys naturally seized upon this very
first chance to get their lines overboard, in
the hope of starting things moving by a
weighty capture.</p>

<p>And the others, anticipating more or less
fun out of the bitter rivalry, lost no opportunity
to &ldquo;sic&rdquo; the contestants on. Just as a
breeze fans a flame, so their frequent allusions
as to the budding qualities of the rivals as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
fishermen kept Nick and Jimmy eager for the
fray.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, when George
secured a tender for his speed boat, while in
Jacksonville, as they were told they would need
such things right along, in order to make landings
where the water was too shoal for the
larger craft to get close to the shore, he selected
a dumpy little flat-bottomed &ldquo;dinky,&rdquo;
just about on a par with the <i>Wireless</i> when
it came to eccentric qualities.</p>

<p>An expert with the oars or a paddle might
manage the affair fairly well; but as Nick was
as clumsy as he was fat, it seemed as though
he would never get the hang of the squatty
tender.</p>

<p>When he sat in the middle, one dip of an
oar would cause the boat to spin wildly around
as if on a pivot; and as to rowing in a straight
course, the thing was utterly beyond Nick&rsquo;s
abilities. So, when he was aiming for a certain
spot, he was wont to approach his intended
goal by a series of eccentric angles.</p>

<p>The flood tide was still coming in lazily, for
they had managed to hit the inlet when the
bar was well covered, wishing to take no
chances. So Nick, after managing to propel
the &ldquo;punkin seed&rdquo; over to the spot near a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
bunch of mangroves, that he had selected as
most promising, set to work.</p>

<p>He tied the boat, first of all, by a piece of
cord, so that it would not float away while he
fished. Then he laboriously got his tackle in
readiness.</p>

<p>Those on the motor boats had kept an eye
on the actions of the two rivals, as if anticipating
that sooner or later they might have
something to laugh over; for Nick was forever
tumbling into difficulties of some sort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Nick will ever get the hang
of that dinky, George,&rdquo; remarked Jack, as he
leaned over the side of the <i>Tramp</i>, peeling
some potatoes which they intended having for
supper; and, as there did not seem to be any
decent chance to cook this ashore, the voyagers
would have to do as they had often done before,
use their little kerosene gas stoves aboard
the several boats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It takes an expert to run that cut-off runt
properly,&rdquo; said Herb, who was also engaged,
wiping his engine, while Josh started operations
looking to the evening meal, the lanky
boy being by all odds the best cook in the party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for the compliment, Herb,&rdquo;
laughed George. &ldquo;It happens that I&rsquo;ve always
been at home in small boats. And there
was something about that stumpy little affair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
that made me take a fancy to her. Nick will
do better after he learns the ropes. And he
generally manages to get there, even if he does
cover twice as much distance as I might. Look
at Jimmy, fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="#image01">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got something, for a fact!&rdquo; exclaimed
Herb</a>; &ldquo;and Nick is excited over it. See him
wiggle around to watch, just as if he feared
the game was going to be settled right in the
start. Hi! sit down, Nick! Want to upset
that cranky thing, do you? Well, it&rsquo;s good
you&rsquo;ve got your air bag fastened on; for without
a life preserver you&rsquo;d drown in this tideway,
if ever you fell over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch Jimmy, will you, boys?&rdquo; chuckled
Jack. &ldquo;Look at the grin on his face as he
pulls his line in. You can see that half his
fun is in keeping an eye on Nick, to enjoy his
confusion and disappointment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! why, the fish is pulling his boat
around, do you notice?&rdquo; demanded George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That looks as if it might be a good one.
There, I thought Jimmy couldn&rsquo;t keep still
much longer. Listen to him yap, would you?&rdquo;
Herb called out.</p>

<p>Jimmy had started to crow over his rival,
as any ordinary boy would be apt to do under
similar conditions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be after gettin&rsquo; downhearted too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
soon, Nick, me bhoy!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Sure, this
is only a little one for a stharter, so it is. Wait
till I get going, and I&rsquo;ll open your eyes good
and sthrong. Och! how he pulls! If only ye
were a bit closer now, I&rsquo;d let ye fale of the
line, to know the sensation. Come in, ye darlint,
and let&rsquo;s have a look at ye. Whirra! but
he&rsquo;s bigger than I thought; and it&rsquo;s me as
hopes he won&rsquo;t upset the boat when I pull him
over the side!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course much of this talk was for the purpose
of making his rival squirm with envy;
though the captive did show signs of being a
strong fighter.</p>

<p>After about five minutes of apparently
strenuous effort, Jimmy concluded that it
would be unwise to risk losing his prisoner by
playing it longer; so he dragged the hooked
fish over the side. There was a flash of bronze
and white that told Jack the story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A channel bass, and something like fifteen
pounds in weight, too. We&rsquo;re sure of fish on
this trip, anyway, with the two of them bending
every energy to the winning of the medal!&rdquo;
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There goes Nick back to his work,&rdquo; said
George. &ldquo;If there are fish here, he hopes to
get his share. But ten to one he&rsquo;s nearly choking
with envy right now, because Jimmy drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the first blood. It&rsquo;s an uphill game for poor
old Nick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Herb went on to remark, &ldquo;the game
will last a whole month, and more; so nobody
can tell how the finish may turn out. Nick
might get hold of a bigger fish any minute.
But it&rsquo;s up to us to encourage &rsquo;em right along.
We&rsquo;ll never want for a fish diet if we do, for
they&rsquo;ll stay up nights to keep at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, I declare, if Nick didn&rsquo;t have a jerk
at his line then; but he failed to hook the rascal!&rdquo;
Jack exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And came near upsetting the boat in his
excitement, too,&rdquo; complained George. &ldquo;If he
does, I can see the finish of my oars, which
will go out of the inlet with the ebb tide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what about Nick; you don&rsquo;t seem to
worry about how he&rsquo;ll act?&rdquo; laughed Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;ll just float around, with that life
preserver holding him up, till one of us pushes
out and tows him ashore. Whatever is he
doing now, do you suppose?&rdquo; George demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throwing out that shark hook of his, with
the clothes line attached,&rdquo; Jack explained.
&ldquo;You see, Nick has evidently made up his
mind to go in for something worth while. He
wants to knock the spots out of Jimmy&rsquo;s hopes
right in the start.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my stars! if he hooks a big shark
while he&rsquo;s sitting in that punkin seed of a
boat, there&rsquo;s bound to be a warm old circus!&rdquo;
Herb declared.</p>

<p>Some little time passed, and those aboard
the anchored motor boats, busily engaged in
their various occupations, had almost forgotten
about the bitter rivalry going on so near
by, when suddenly they were startled by a
great shout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Nick, this time!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, as
he jumped to the side of the <i>Tramp</i> to observe
what was taking place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And say, he&rsquo;s fast to a whopper, as sure as
you live!&rdquo; cried Herb.</p>

<p>George added his contribution on the heels
of the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That string&rsquo;s broke away, just as I expected,
and there goes Nick and the punkin
seed, full tilt for the inlet! By all that&rsquo;s out,
fellows, he must have caught a whale that time,
fresh run from the sea. Hi! hold on there,
Nick, that&rsquo;s my boat!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br />
<small>THE WARNING RATTLE.</small></h2>


<p>Jack Stormways was a quick-witted lad. He
had proved this fact on numerous occasions in
the past, within the memory of his chums.</p>

<p>When anything sudden happened, while
others might appear to be spellbound, and
waste precious seconds in staring, Jack was
very apt to be on the jump, and <i>doing</i>.</p>

<p>So in the present instance, while it might
appear more or less comical, seeing the fat
boy crouched in that silly little boat belonging
to the <i>Wireless</i>, and being dragged through
the water at a most rapid rate by the shark he
had hooked, there was always an element of
danger connected with the affair.</p>

<p>And so Jack, after taking that one look out
over the water, sprang forward, and started
dragging his anchor aboard with all possible
speed. That done, he next applied himself
to getting power on the boat, which fortunately
could be done with a simple turning over of
the engine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello! are you going to chase the runaway
with the <i>Tramp</i>?&rdquo; cried Herb, who was in the
act of climbing over the side into his tender,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
as though meaning to put out in pursuit himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; jump aboard here, Herb; I might
need help!&rdquo; came the answer; and, accustomed
to respecting Jack&rsquo;s judgment, the one addressed
managed to clamber over the side of
the <i>Tramp</i> just as that craft started off.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nick was going at a great rate,
not in a direct line for the inlet, but following
jerky, eccentric angles, as though the shark
hardly knew what to do, on feeling the contact
with the point of the big hook at the end
of the chain.</p>

<p>Several times the fat boy seemed on the
point of creeping forward to get at the rope
that was fastened to a cleat in the bow of the
dinky. It was George who roared at him on
such occasions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep still, Nick; sit down, can&rsquo;t you?
You&rsquo;ll upset sure, if you don&rsquo;t lie flat! Jack&rsquo;s
coming out after you on the jump! Hey, look
out there, Jimmy, or you&rsquo;ll get foul, too!
Whew! what a race horse you&rsquo;ve got fast to,
Nick. If only you could land him, Jimmy&rsquo;s
name would be Mud. There he goes again,
heading for the bar! Look at the water shooting
up on either side of that dandy little boat,
would you? And ain&rsquo;t Nick having the ride
of his life, though? There he goes, crawling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
along up to the bow again. Perhaps he wants
to cut loose; small blame to him if he does!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody was either laughing, or shouting
advice to Nick, while this exciting little drama
was taking place.</p>

<p>Indeed, Nick himself seemed to be the only
one who was not getting some measure of fun
out of the affair. His usually red face looked
pale, as he managed to reach the squatty bow
of the little boat. But when he found that it
was dragged down by the action of the fish, as
well as his own weight, he drew back again
in alarm, for water had come rushing aboard.</p>

<p>Once the motor boat got started, of course
it speedily came up with the runaway. Jack
had given the wheel into the charge of Herb,
who was fully competent to run things. This
allowed the other an opportunity to do anything
that offered, looking to the rescue of
poor frightened Nick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get me out of this, won&rsquo;t you, Jack? I
don&rsquo;t like it one little bit,&rdquo; pleaded the fat
boy; and then, as some new freak on the part
of the shark caused the dinky to lunge sideways
in a fearful manner, he shouted in new
alarm: &ldquo;Quit it, you ugly beast! Who wants
to nab you now? I pass, I tell you! Let go,
and get out of this! Wow! look at him splash
the water, Jack, would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He wanted to take a look at you, that&rsquo;s
all,&rdquo; Jack called out. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;d
better cut loose, and let your hook go, Nick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got any knife; it went overboard
the first thing. Besides,&rdquo; added the occupant
of the dinky, who was now once more crouching
in the stern, &ldquo;if I go up there, the water
just pours in. I&rsquo;m sitting in it right now.
Jack, can&rsquo;t you think of some way to make him
leave me alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I might,&rdquo; came the reply, as the
skipper of the <i>Tramp</i> dodged back into the
hunting cabin of his boat.</p>

<p>He almost immediately reappeared again,
holding a rope in his hands. This he made
fast to a cleat at the bow; and then, turning
to Herb, asked him to bring the motor boat
as close to the fleeing dinky as possible.</p>

<p>Leaning down, Jack managed to get a peculiar
sort of hitch around the taut line; and
a quick jerk seemed to secure his own rope,
so that it would not slip. His next action was
to take a keen knife, and lay its edge upon the
line, close to the spot where it was fastened
to the wobbling dinky.</p>

<p>Of course it instantly parted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s too bad! Now I&rsquo;ve lost my
tackle!&rdquo; cried Nick; although he looked vastly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
relieved at finding that he was no longer fast
to the queer sea horse.</p>

<p>Jack paid no further attention to the rescued
chum. The fight was now to be all between
himself and the shark.</p>

<p>Quickly the line paid out, until there came a
heavy jerk, and then once more it became taut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bully! it&rsquo;s holding fine, Jack!&rdquo; shouted
Herb, who had watched to see the result; for
he doubted whether the connection, brought
about under such difficulties, would be maintained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, gradually bring the boat to a full
stop,&rdquo; said Jack, as he again reached back
into the cabin, and drew out a rifle. &ldquo;As soon
as you&rsquo;ve got him halted, begin to back up.
That will drag him to the top, you understand;
and I&rsquo;ll have a chance to pot the rascal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; declared Herb, who could
grasp a thing readily enough, even if slow to
originate clever schemes himself.</p>

<p>Just as Jack had said, when the pull was
being exerted in the other direction, the struggling
monster was presently seen splashing at
a tremendous rate, though unable to resist the
drawing powers of the ten-horsepower engine.</p>

<p>Jack, crouching there, with one elbow resting
on his knee, took as good an aim as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
conditions allowed. Then came the sharp report
of the gun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoop! you hit him all right, that time,
Jack!&rdquo; shouted Herb; as there ensued a tremendous
floundering at the end of the rope.
&ldquo;But he ain&rsquo;t knocked out yet. Give him
another dose of the same sort!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Across the water came the cries of the others
who were watching this exciting scene. And
loudest of all could be heard the voice of Nick,
now once more in possession of his nerve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it to him, Jack! Pound the measly
old pirate good and hard! He won&rsquo;t try that
game again in a hurry, I tell you! Hey!
Jimmy, you ain&rsquo;t in it this time, with that
little minnow of yours. Hurrah! that&rsquo;s the
time you poked him in the slats, Jack! Trust
you for knowing how! I guess he&rsquo;s a sure
goner after that meal of cold lead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack had fired a second time; and, just as
the wildly excited Nick said, he seemed to have
met with better success than on the former
occasion. The trapped sea monster threshed
the water still, but not in the same violent manner
as before; and his fury seemed to be rapidly
diminishing as the result of his wounds
began to be felt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, stop her, Herb, and start ahead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
slowly!&rdquo; Jack called out, hovering over the
spot where the line was fast to the cleat.</p>

<p>The boy at the wheel did as he was directed;
and as the line became slack Jack took it in,
ready to hastily secure the same about another
cleat in case the dying shark developed a disposition
to make a last mad dash.</p>

<p>But evidently the big fish was &ldquo;all in,&rdquo; and
when they reached a point nearly over where
he lay, there were seen only a few spasmodic
movements to his body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drag him near the other boats, so we
can pull the old fellow up on that little beach,&rdquo;
Jack suggested.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, and the six boys were all
ashore, laying hold of the rope in order to
drag the captured fish out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, he&rsquo;s some whopper, let me tell you!&rdquo;
exclaimed George, as, having drawn the shark
high and dry, they all hastened to examine
the capture.</p>

<p>Nick was dancing with joy, and his eyes
fairly beamed as he stood beside the great bulk,
putting one foot up on it after the manner in
which he had seen noted hunters do, in pictures
that told of their exploits when hunting
big game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, how about it, Jimmy?&rdquo; he demanded,
as Jack was cutting the stout hook from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
jaw of the monster. &ldquo;Think this is some punkins,
don&rsquo;t you, now. Three hundred pounds,
if it weighs an ounce. Have to hustle some,
let me tell you, my boy, if you ever expect to
go a notch higher than this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrah, come off, would you!&rdquo; indignantly
cried Jimmy. &ldquo;Sure, ye wouldn&rsquo;t be claiming
that ye took this same ould sea wolf, and inter
it in the competition. I do be laving it to Jack
here, if that&rsquo;s fair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I hooked it, you all saw that?&rdquo; expostulated
Nick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; remarked Herb, looking
very serious; &ldquo;I was under the impression that
the shark had got you, up to the time Jack
came along with his little gun, and tapped him
on the head. How about it, Commodore? Can
Nick enter any claim to having caught this
prize?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Jack, smiling; &ldquo;let me read
out the exact words of the wager. I&rsquo;ve got a
copy right here in my note book. Listen now,
both of you. It reads like this: &lsquo;Each contestant
shall have the liberty of fishing as
often as he pleases, and the fish may be taken
in any sort of manner; the one stipulation
being that the capture shall be undertaken by
the contestant, <i>alone and unaided</i>; and that he
must have possession of the fish long enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to show the same, and have its weight either
estimated or proven.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That settles your goose, me bhoy!&rdquo; croaked
Jimmy, gleefully; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m top notch in the
game up to the prisent moment. Do we get
busy again, Nick, I say; or are ye satisfied to
lit me claim first blood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems mighty small, that after
grabbing that nice fellow, I&rsquo;ve got to let the
honors go for the day,&rdquo; remarked the fat boy.
&ldquo;And I guess I&rsquo;ve had quite enough excitement
for once. I&rsquo;m all soaked in the bargain;
and it feels kind of cool, you see. So I won&rsquo;t
fish any more right now. But next time, just
you look out for yourself, Jimmy. I&rsquo;m after
you like hot cakes. Say, ain&rsquo;t we going to have
that fish for supper, boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick was a voracious eater. He liked nothing
in the world so much as to enjoy a glorious
meal; and long after his chums were through,
he often sat there, finishing the dishes. On the
other hand, lean, lanky Josh, while possessed
of a knack for cooking all sorts of good things,
had a poor appetite, and often merely nibbled
at his food, to the wonderment and disgust of
the fat boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you get to work and clean it,&rdquo; said Jack,
&ldquo;I think there ought to be plenty to go around.
But you&rsquo;ll find that one-third of a channel bass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
is the head. As we had one before, we know
it&rsquo;s worth eating, so pitch in, Nick. Since you
lost your knife overboard, take mine here, and
get busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It pleased Jimmy to strut around near
where his rival was occupied with his menial
task, and make occasional remarks about &ldquo;his
prize,&rdquo; calculated to rub salt in Nick&rsquo;s wounds.
But after all, the fat boy was good-natured,
and took things in a matter-of-fact way. Besides,
he was grimly resolved that sooner or
later, by hook or by crook, even if it were a
fish-hook, he would overcome this strong lead
of his rival in the race for high honors.</p>

<p>As more or less fuel had been found ashore,
and Josh expressed his desire to manage the
supper, as head chef, it was found advisable
to change their plans. And so, assisted by
many willing workers, the lanky wonder
started operations.</p>

<p>He was soon bustling around, looking very
consequential. Nick had made him a <i>chef&rsquo;s</i>
cap out of a piece of white muslin, which he
was requested to wear on all such occasions as
this, when in charge of affairs about the cooking
fire.</p>

<p>Nick himself was busy trying to mend some
little contraption, purchased on the street in
Jacksonville, and which he had broken before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
he could have any fun with the same as originally
intended.</p>

<p>Jack, stepping off from the <i>Tramp</i>, where
he had gone to get some of the tinware needed
for coffee and substantial food, was electrified
to hear Josh give a whoop; and at the same
instant his ears were assailed by a dreadful
rattling noise that sounded for all the world
like the angry buzz of a diamond-back rattlesnake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thunder and Mars! Great Jerusalem!
I&rsquo;m struck in the leg!&rdquo; bellowed the lengthy
Josh, as he came tumbling back from the edge
of the bushes, grabbing at his shin in a frantic
manner.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />
<small>DOWN THE INDIAN RIVER.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Now, what d&rsquo;ye know about that?&rdquo; exclaimed
Nick, scrambling to his feet after his
usual clumsy way; for when the fat boy happened
to become excited he generally &ldquo;fell
all over himself,&rdquo; as Josh put it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ails you, Josh?&rdquo; demanded Herb.</p>

<p>No sooner had the lengthy one reached a
spot near the fire than he threw himself down,
and commenced frantically to pull up the left
leg of his trousers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gosh! looky there, will you, fellers?&rdquo; he
bellowed, as if in a panic. &ldquo;He sure got me
that time; I guess I&rsquo;m a goner. Won&rsquo;t one
of you get down and suck the poison out for
me? You know, I&rsquo;d do it in your case. Oh!
please hurry up. My leg&rsquo;s beginning to swell
right now, and in a few minutes it&rsquo;ll be too
late!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poison!&rdquo; echoed Herb, who seemed to be
in utter ignorance of the entire matter, and
could only stare at the little speck of blood
showing on the white skin as if horribly fascinated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, oh! didn&rsquo;t you hear the terrible buzz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
he gave when he stuck his fangs in me?&rdquo;
groaned poor Josh.</p>

<p>Jack had thrown himself down alongside
the wounded one, and was minutely examining
the hurt. He looked up at this juncture, and
to the astonishment of Herb and George, was
apparently grinning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brace up, Josh,&rdquo; he said, cheerfully;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re not going to kick the bucket yet
awhile, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! how kind of you to tell me so, Jack;
but how do you know? Please tell me why you
say that,&rdquo; pleaded the cook, beginning to look
relieved; for he had fallen long ago into
placing the utmost confidence in whatever
Jack believed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, in the first place, there&rsquo;s only one
tiny puncture, you see; and if this was a snake
bite there&rsquo;d be the plain marks of <i>two</i> fangs,&rdquo;
Jack announced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds all right, Jack; but perhaps this
critter only had one fang. Didn&rsquo;t you hear
the angry shake of his old rattle-box when he
struck? It gave me a cold chill, because, right
at the same second, I felt something stick me.
I&rsquo;ll never forget the awful sensation, even if
I do live through it,&rdquo; and Josh rubbed his leg
vigorously, as though hoping that by inducing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a circulation he might avert the threatened
dire catastrophe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you only look around right now,
perhaps you&rsquo;ll discover the source of that same
buzz,&rdquo; Jack went on, soberly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, whatever can you mean?&rdquo; Josh
stammered, staring his amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Notice how Nick, for instance, is trying
the best he knows how to keep his face
straight, even while he&rsquo;s just shaking all over
with the laugh that&rsquo;s in him. Stand up, Nick;
and hold out that hand you&rsquo;ve got behind your
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack pointed rather sternly at the culprit
while speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ll have to &rsquo;fess,&rdquo; mumbled
the fat boy, as he whipped the hand in
question around, so that all could see what he
was holding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s that boozy little rattle he picked
up in Jacksonville, and broke on the first
trial!&rdquo; exclaimed George. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been dabbling
at it ever since, trying to mend the old
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;and just succeeded in
getting it to working. Here, give it to me,
Nick, and I&rsquo;ll show them how it whirrs when
you turn it around rapidly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking the little wooden contrivance, Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
gave it a series of quick turns, with the result
that a loud angry buzzing was produced, not
unlike the warning rattle of an enraged snake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that was it, Jack!&rdquo; cried the relieved
Josh. &ldquo;Thank you for showing me, too. It
sure takes a big load off my mind, because
you&rsquo;ll never know what a nasty feeling I had
at the time. It was a mean dodge, Nick, and
I can&rsquo;t forget it in a hurry, either. But Jack,
that don&rsquo;t explain everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re thinking of that sudden little
pain you had in the leg?&rdquo; suggested the other,
nodding his head understandingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet I am!&rdquo; Josh declared. &ldquo;It took
me at the identical second I heard that whirr.
If it wasn&rsquo;t a snake bit me, what did, Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out right away, so&rsquo;s to relieve
your mind,&rdquo; Jack went on. &ldquo;Lead the way to
the very spot where you were when you heard
the sound, and felt that sudden pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s dead easy,&rdquo; remarked the tall boy;
and as he said this he scrambled to his feet,
his trousers still rolled up to his knee, and
limped across the camp.</p>

<p>Jack noticed, however, that he approached
the place cautiously, as though not yet wholly
convinced that there might not be a dreadful
diamond-back rattler lying in ambush, waiting
for another chance to puncture him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There it is, right in front of you, Jack!&rdquo;
Josh cried, pointing; &ldquo;I happened to want a
handful of dry timber to hurry up the fire, and
stepped over here, because I&rsquo;d noticed just the
thing under this lone palmetto. Just as I
banged into that little bunch of brush it happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, fellows, and you&rsquo;ll see what he
ran against!&rdquo; he announced, taking hold of
the long, narrow, dark green leaf of a plant
that was growing there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A plant they call Spanish Bayonet,&rdquo; replied
Jack, seriously now. &ldquo;You see, like lots
of semi-tropical plants, such as the yucca, century
plant or Mexican aloe, and others, it&rsquo;s got
a sharp point, almost like a needle. Well, just
as luck would have it, Josh banged into one of
these leaves at the very second Nick began to
rattle his alarm box. No wonder he got a
shock! It was enough to stagger the bravest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it was what you might call a coincidence?&rdquo;
suggested Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh! a mighty tough one, too,&rdquo; grunted
Josh, as he rubbed his injured limb ere turning
down his trouser leg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But see here, fellows, are we going to let
our funny man try that stunt every little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
while?&rdquo; demanded George, frowning at his
shipmate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I vote for one against such a thing,&rdquo; declared
Herb. &ldquo;That nasty little box has too
suggestive a rattle to please me. If I was going
through the saw palmetto scrub, and he happened
to amuse himself with it, I just know
I&rsquo;d jump ten feet. It would make life miserable
for me right along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimmy, what do you say?&rdquo; demanded Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me too!&rdquo; piped up the Irish lad. &ldquo;Sure
it do be giving me the crapes just to listen to
that thing go whirring around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hear the verdict, Nick?&rdquo; said Jack,
pretending to assume the air of a judge addressing
the prisoner in the dock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I ain&rsquo;t saying a word,&rdquo; Nick replied,
with a shrug of his fat shoulders. &ldquo;I c&rsquo;n see
myself that it would be a mean trick to play.
Never thought much about it that way. Give
her a toss, Jack. And Josh, I hope you won&rsquo;t
hold it against me too hard. You know, you&rsquo;re
top-notch yet in that bully contest of ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this way did the contrite joker attempt
to buy peace in the camp; and that he was
fairly successful might be judged from the
grin that slowly began to spread over the thin
face of the cook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Nick; so long as it don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
happen again I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to think too much
about it. Fact is, it&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to give me a cold
shiver every time I hear anything like that
rattle. And now I&rsquo;ll be getting back to my
work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t want anybody to suck the
poison out?&rdquo; asked Nick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let up on that, now, will you? I guess I&rsquo;m
able to hobble around yet,&rdquo; and bending down,
Josh gathered some of the dry trash that he
wanted, to hurry the fire on with.</p>

<p>Jack had tossed the little rattle-box contrivance
into the fire, where it was soon entirely
consumed.</p>

<p>Although they ate supper ashore, it was considered
wise to sleep aboard. The only one
who grumbled at this decision was poor Nick.
He had a hard lot to follow, for the narrow
speed boat offered but poor sleeping accommodations
for two, and many a time the stout
youth was wont to bemoan his sad fate as he
rubbed his aching sides in the morning.</p>

<p>They left the camp at Mosquito Inlet an
hour after sunrise on the following morning,
and started down past New Smyrna, heading
for the Haulover Canal that connects Mosquito
Lagoon with the famous Indian River.</p>

<p>Under Jack&rsquo;s wise guidance they found
little trouble in navigating the broad or narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
waters of the various channels. As steamboats
passed through daily in the season, there
were plenty of &ldquo;targets&rdquo; pointing out the
deeper waters; and where the lagoon happened
to be very shallow, canals had been dredged.</p>

<p>Taking it leisurely, they arrived at Titusville
about two in the afternoon. Here one of
the boys went for the mail, and also to pick
up the few things they had on the list of &ldquo;necessities
wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the western shore of the river is pretty
thickly settled now, it was decided to cross
over, and skirt along Merritt&rsquo;s Island until
near its foot, where they could probably find
a spot free from civilization&rsquo;s touch; and this
was what appealed to the motor boat boys at
all times&mdash;wild solitude.</p>

<p>Long before evening overtook them they
had come to a halt, and anchored the boats
close to the eastern shore, just beyond a point
that would protect them from any wild
norther that might chance to spring up. All
of them had heard so much about these
dreaded storms that swoop down upon the pilgrims
in small boats when navigating Florida
waters that they were always on the watch for
their coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Jack!&rdquo; exclaimed George, as they
landed in their small dinkies, intending to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
again have a fire, and be congenial; &ldquo;look out
yonder on the river, and tell me if that ain&rsquo;t
the same strange launch we saw twice before
above.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, George, that&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; replied
the other, as he whirled around, to shade
his eyes with one hand in order to see the
better; for the sun was just going down beyond
the wide river, Rockledge way, and shone
fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had the glasses now, I&rsquo;d like to see
who they are,&rdquo; George went on. &ldquo;Seems to
me the parties on that boat act queer. They
dodge out of sight whenever they think we&rsquo;re
watching. I don&rsquo;t just like the way they act,
Jack, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the other.
&ldquo;That may be only imagination with you,
George. The only thing that strikes me as
queer is that the boat seems to be as near a
ringer for the <i>Tramp</i> as anything I ever
struck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! you&rsquo;re on the job now, when you
say that, and funny I hadn&rsquo;t noticed it before,
Jack,&rdquo; George declared. &ldquo;Now that you mention
it, I declare if it isn&rsquo;t just remarkable. I
suppose all of our boats have doubles, somewhere
in the country; for the makers have a
model they follow out heaps of times in a season;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
but all the same, it strikes a fellow as
queer to run across a duplicate of the boat he&rsquo;s
kind of looked on as his own especial
property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; grunted Nick, who had been near
enough to overhear this talk, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right sorry
for somebody then, if there&rsquo;s a ringer for the
<i>Wireless</i>. They have my sympathy, I tell you
that right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But George only sniffed, and disdained to
notice the slur cast upon his pet. It seemed
that the more the others found fault with the
actions of the <i>Wireless</i>, the greater became his
attachment for the erratic boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re ahead of us again, for one
thing,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;It looks like a game
of tag, right along; now we&rsquo;re leading, and
then they forge ahead. I&rsquo;m just going to keep
tabs on that boat, for fun; and some fine day
perhaps I&rsquo;ll have my curiosity satisfied. I&rsquo;d
give something to know who they are, and why
they act like they do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! they won&rsquo;t keep me awake much, I
tell you that,&rdquo; said Nick, loftily. &ldquo;When I
bother my head it&rsquo;s going to be about something
worth while&mdash;understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; remarked George, quickly. &ldquo;Something
that threatens a calamity in the feeding
line, for instance; a running short of supplies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
That&rsquo;s the subject Nick worries about most.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, is there any more important business
known than supplying the human engine with
plenty of fuel?&rdquo; demanded the other, sturdily.
&ldquo;Perhaps the engineer may be the more important
fellow of the two; but the stoker is
just as necessary, if the machine is to be kept
going. But there&rsquo;s Josh calling me to help
him. I&rsquo;m always Johnny-on-the-spot when
it comes to helping Josh get grub ready&rdquo;&mdash;and
he waddled off serenely; for Nick was so
happily constituted that no matter what jabs
he received from his chums, they seemed to
roll from him like water from a duck&rsquo;s back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear the mullet jump?&rdquo; remarked Jack,
as they ate supper after night had set in.
&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye know, fellows, this ought to be a good
time to try that fish spear?&mdash;for we&rsquo;ll have an
hour of dark before the old moon peeps up,
and there isn&rsquo;t a breath of wind to ruffle the
water. Jimmy, I appoint you to push me
around a bit, and see what we can do, though
I wouldn&rsquo;t count too much on any big score.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on, Jack, darlint,&rdquo; Jimmy immediately
responded; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s ready I am now.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />
<small>THAT SAME OLD UNLUCKY WIRELESS.</small></h2>


<p>Moving about in the steadiest of the little
tenders, with a flare in the bow, and Jimmy to
gently push in the stern, Jack sought to strike
some game fish. His success was not very flattering,
though he certainly did enjoy the experience.
It was really worth while to peer
down into the shallow depths, and see what lay
there.</p>

<p>Several times he caught glimpses of channel
bass, sheepshead, or sea trout, which last
is only another name for the weak fish of the
North; but as a rule they flashed away before
he could strike.</p>

<p>He did succeed in spearing one trout of
about three pounds, much to Jimmy&rsquo;s delight.
And later on, he struck a nasty creature with
what seemed to be a barb on the top of his tail,
which he thrust around in a savage manner
as Jack held him up on the end of his pole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out, and don&rsquo;t get too close to him,
Jimmy,&rdquo; Jack warned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure now and I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the other,
&ldquo;for, to till the truth, it&rsquo;s me as don&rsquo;t like the
looks of that little fixin&rsquo; on the ind of his tail.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be what they call a stingaree or
stingray,&rdquo; Jack went on. &ldquo;I never saw one
before, but I&rsquo;ve read a lot about &rsquo;em. They
say he can poison you, if ever he hits with that
barb. You know what a mudcat can do, out on
the Mississippi; well, this is the same thing,
only a whole lot worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drop the squirmin&rsquo; bog-trotter back into
the wather, Jack, me bhoy; for &rsquo;tis us as don&rsquo;t
want too close an acquaintance with him.
He&rsquo;d make it too warrm for us, by the same
token,&rdquo; Jimmy declared; and Jack complied
only too willingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ve had about enough of this, so
let&rsquo;s go ashore,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>

<p>Nick awaited them, eager to ascertain the
amount of their captures. He whiffed on discovering
only one fish aboard the dinky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh! could eat that all by myself, and
then not half try,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, then; if you do the needful to
it, you&rsquo;re welcome, Nick,&rdquo; laughed the one
who had captured the sea trout.</p>

<p>Of course, Nick became suddenly suspicious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t play any trick on me, now,
I hope, Jack, and get me to eat a fish that
wasn&rsquo;t fit for the human stomach?&rdquo; he questioned,
uneasily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they call a sea trout down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
here; but up North it&rsquo;s the weakfish, and said
to be as toothsome as almost anything that
swims,&rdquo; Jack remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! all right, then I accept your kind offer.
I&rsquo;ll get busy right now, and have him ready
for the morning. Wish you had got one
apiece, I hate to seem greedy, you know, fellows,&rdquo;
he went on to say, as if thinking he
ought to excuse himself.</p>

<p>When the morning came Nick was astir before
anybody else, for he had a duty on his
mind. He bothered Josh so much that finally
the cook made him start a blaze of his own,
over which he could prepare his breakfast;
and Nick managed pretty well, considering
that he had never made a study of the art of
cookery.</p>

<p>They started off at a booming pace. The
run down Indian River that day would always
remain a pleasant memory with the young
cruisers. Fort Pierce was reached on schedule
time, after passing through the Narrows,
and securing a mess of oysters from a boat
engaged in dredging there.</p>

<p>Again one of the voyagers went after mail
and supplies. There was always something
lacking, besides the necessary gasoline. Six
growing boys can develop enormous appetites
when living a life in the open, and upon salt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
water. Besides, there was Nick, capable of
downing any two of his chums when it came
to devouring stuff. No wonder, then, that the
question of supplies was always uppermost on
their minds.</p>

<p>Once more they headed across to the eastern
shore, where they would be more apt to find a
quiet nook for the next night&rsquo;s camp. One
more day&rsquo;s run, if all went well, would take
them to Lake Worth; and after serious consultation
it had been decided that they would,
when the right chance came, put to sea through
that inlet, to make the run south to Miami.</p>

<p>Once again had both Nick and Jimmy been
seized with the fever of rivalry. During the
day they had been busily engaged preparing
set lines, which they expected to put out over
night, in the hope of making a big haul.</p>

<p>Nick had bought a lot of material in Jacksonville.
This in the main consisted of large
hooks, with snells made of brass wire, which
latter he manufactured himself, Jack having
shown him how; and a large swivel at the end
of the foot length. Then he had secured a
large quantity of very strong cotton cord,
made waterproof by some tarring process,
after the manner of the rigging aboard sailing
vessels.</p>

<p>One thing Jack had bought in Fort Pierce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
which they understood would be pretty much
of a necessity during the many weeks they expected
to spend among the keys that dotted
the whole coast line of Florida.</p>

<p>This was called a cast-net, and was some
eight feet in length, though when fully extended
it would cover a circle twice that in
diameter.</p>

<p>There were leads along the outer edges, and
a series of drawing strings running up
through a ring in the center.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Jack, that evening, when
they were ashore, &ldquo;I watched a fellow use one
up above, and even took a few lessons, so I&rsquo;ve
kind of got the hang on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then please show us?&rdquo; asked Nick,
eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to him, would you?&rdquo; exclaimed
Herb; &ldquo;to hear him talk you&rsquo;d think Nick
had a sneaking idea he might some day haul
in a big giant of a fish in this flimsy net.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but it&rsquo;s good to get mullet for bait,&rdquo;
the fat boy remonstrated; &ldquo;and as I expect to
do lots of fishing on this trip&mdash;and it may not
always be convenient for Jack to haul the
net&mdash;why, I thought I had ought to know the
ropes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good boy, Nick!&rdquo; laughed Jack; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
be only too glad to show every fellow all I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
know, which isn&rsquo;t any too much. Now, here&rsquo;s
the way you gather up the line, so as to let go
suddenly. Then you hold the net like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure do ye ate some of the leads?&rdquo; questioned
Jimmy, seeing Jack take several between
his teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! not any! but this is one of the times
when a fellow wishes he had been born with
three hands. As I haven&rsquo;t, I must hold these
leads by my teeth. The next thing is to swing
the whole net around this way, and let fly with
a rotary motion, at the same time letting go
with your teeth. That is a very important
thing to remember, for you might stand to lose
a few out of your jaw if you held on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo; remarked George; &ldquo;and the
net flings open as it whirls through the air,
falling on the water that way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so, with the leads taking the outer
edge rapidly down. Then, by pulling at the
line, which is tied, you see, to all these strings,
the net is drawn shut like a big purse, enclosing
anything that was under it when it struck the
water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One by one they made trials with the net,
but all of them proved pretty clumsy. Jimmy
was nearly dragged into the shallow water
when he made his first attempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glory be!&rdquo; he howled, as he put his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
quickly to his mouth; &ldquo;if I didn&rsquo;t have the
teeth of a horse I do belave I&rsquo;d have lost the
whole set thin. But once bit, twict shy. Nixt
toime I&rsquo;ll let go, rest easy on that. And I&rsquo;m
going to get the hang of that Spanish cast-net,
if it takes ivery tooth in me head, so I
am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll do it, Jimmy, never fear,&rdquo;
laughed Jack. &ldquo;That do-or-die spirit is going
to win the day. Here, Nick, try it again.
You seem to have got the knack of it pretty
well, only you want to throw harder, or the
mullet will get away before the net falls on
the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally the boys tired of the strenuous exertion,
and as Josh announced supper ready,
they turned their attention to more pleasant
duties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is something in which I can shine,
anyhow,&rdquo; chuckled Nick, as he sat there, with
a pannikin cram-full of various good things,
and a cup of steaming coffee on the ground
close beside him.</p>

<p>No one disputed the assertion; in fact, there
was a general grin, and a series of nods
around the circle, to prove that for once their
opinions were unanimous.</p>

<p>Frolicsome &rsquo;coons seemed numerous at this
camp on Hutchinson&rsquo;s Island. They attempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to pillage, after the boys had settled
down to sleep. Twice was the quiet of the
camp disturbed by the rattle of tin pans, and
upon investigation it was found that some
prowling little animal had endeavored to
devour the hominy Josh had cooked, intending
to fry slices of the same for breakfast.</p>

<p>Nick made out to believe that it might have
been a wildcat, or possibly a bear, until Jack
showed him the plain tracks of long slender
feet close to the receptacle of the hominy, and
explained that only a raccoon could have made
these.</p>

<p>When the morning came, an early start was
made, for they had quite a little run down the
river, through Jupiter Narrows, and then by
means of the canal into Lake Worth.</p>

<p>Arriving at this latter place early in the
afternoon, they spent some time looking
about&mdash;although it was out of the season for
the fashionable crowd that flock to Palm
Beach during February and March.</p>

<p>Jack had studied his coast charts most carefully.
He knew they would have a dangerous
outside passage to Miami, that must consume
some seven hours, because of the <i>Comfort&rsquo;s</i>
slowness; and as they could not afford to take
any chances, it became absolutely necessary
that they wait until the weather gave positive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
signs of remaining fairly decent during the
day.</p>

<p>As this meant a combination of favoring
breezes and calm waters, it was impossible to
tell how long they might have to wait. It
might mean one day, and then again they could
be kept here at Lake Worth a week.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wondering why I&rsquo;m so particular,
fellows,&rdquo; Jack had remarked, when they
talked over the matter among themselves, &ldquo;especially
when we made a heap of outside runs
coming down the coast. But this is really the
worst of the bunch, and I reckon much more
dangerous than any we&rsquo;ve got ahead of us.
For seventy miles here there isn&rsquo;t really a
decent harbor where a small boat could put in
to escape a sudden change in weather. And
when things do go crooked down here they
beat the band. The nearer you get to the
tropics the harder the winds can howl when
they want to show their teeth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Jack,&rdquo; remarked Herb;
&ldquo;we depend on you to use good judgment in
all such matters. And you can see how much
we rely on what you decide, when we&rsquo;re ready
to follow you like sheep do the bellwether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder, now,&rdquo; remarked George, &ldquo;if
that bally little boat that&rsquo;s a ringer for the
<i>Tramp</i> has gone further south?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you ask that?&rdquo; Jack inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, ever since she passed us that evening
across from Rockledge I haven&rsquo;t seen
hide nor hair of the mystery. So somehow I
reckon she must either be further down the
lake, or else gone to Miami by the outside
route, like we intend to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That don&rsquo;t necessarily follow,&rdquo; Jack
laughed, for he saw that George actually had
the subject on his mind, and was deeply interested.
&ldquo;The boat might have been in any one
of twenty little coves we passed on the way
down. Or, again, she could have been prowling
in some of the many passages about the
Narrows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; George declared, stubbornly,
as though his mind were set, and nothing could
move him; &ldquo;you mark my word, Jack, we&rsquo;ll
set eyes on that sneaker again, before we&rsquo;re
done with this trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, perhaps!&rdquo; said Jack, turning away,
as though the subject did not interest him to
any great extent; for he did not happen to be
built on the same lines as his chum, who had a
little more than his share both of suspicion
and also curiosity.</p>

<p>The next day they anxiously waited for
Jack&rsquo;s decision; but the wind was much too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
strong, and from a quarter that caused whitecaps
to appear out on the ocean.</p>

<p>So the start had to be postponed, much to
the regret of the entire six, all of whom wished
to get the dangerous run over with as speedily
as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better luck tomorrow, fellows,&rdquo; said Jack,
who had made it a point to look at things in
the light that it was foolish to worry over
what could not be altered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then here&rsquo;s to put in a whole day, fishing
over on that pier at the beach,&rdquo; declared Nick,
making a run for the place where the three
motor boats were at anchor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whirra! now, if ye do be afther thinking
ye&rsquo;re going to get me goat, it&rsquo;s another guess
ye do be having, I&rsquo;m telling ye, Nick, me
bhoy!&rdquo; remarked Jimmy, as he also hastened
away.</p>

<p>And they kept diligently at it through the
better part of the entire day, though with indifferent
success. Either the fish were shy,
knowing the grim determination of the two
patient anglers, or else it was a poor day for
the sport.</p>

<p>When they mutually agreed to give it up,
while they had a mess that would do for supper,
neither of them had added any notch to
his record for big fish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>As October is possibly the best time of the
year to expect quiet weather along the South
Atlantic coast, Jack had high hopes that the
morrow would see them on their way toward
Miami. Nor were his expectations doomed to
disappointment, for in the morning there
seemed to be not the slightest reason for further
postponing the run.</p>

<p>Accordingly hurried preparations for breakfast
were made, in order to take full advantage
of the opportunity.</p>

<p>All of them were glad when they made the
dash over the Lake Worth bar in good order,
and found themselves on the heaving bosom of
the mighty sea, with their motor boats pointing
to the south.</p>

<p>Steadily they kept on, as the hours passed,
and the sun mounted in the sky. Jack was
ever on the watch for any sign of a change,
knowing what such might mean to cruisers in
small boats caught far from a harbor.</p>

<p>Jimmy was watching his face, under the belief
that he could tell in that way if any trouble
threatened. When he saw how the skipper of
the <i>Tramp</i> turned his glasses frequently
toward the southwest, he took a look in that
quarter himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is it the clouds that do be paping up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
along beyant the shore line giving ye concern,
Jack?&rdquo; he asked, a bit anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know as they mean much,
but all the same I think I&rsquo;d feel better if we
were swinging to our mudhooks back of Key
Biscayne,&rdquo; Jack replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About how far do we chanst to be away,
this minute?&rdquo; the other continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of ten miles, which would mean an
hour&rsquo;s run for the <i>Comfort</i>. This is the time
when she drags us back. George and myself
could have made shelter an hour ago, if we had
wanted to put on all speed. And I just know
George is growling to himself right now, because
he has to check his love for racing
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack had hardly said these words when
Jimmy broke out into a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, that do be a toime when ye are away
off, me bhoy,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what way, Jimmy?&rdquo; demanded the
skipper, laying his glasses aside, and taking
the wheel from the hands of his helper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If so ye take a look over to the blissed ould
<i>Wireless</i>, upon me worrd ye&rsquo;ll discover that
the bally boat has stopped short. Like enough
that ingine has gone back on poor George
again, just as it always does when we get in a
place where it counts. Yes, he&rsquo;s beckoning for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
us to come close. That&rsquo;s what it must mean,
Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew! that would be tough luck!&rdquo; muttered
Jack, as he changed the course of the
little <i>Tramp</i>, and again cast an uneasy look in
the direction where those suspicious and dark
clouds were shoving their heads above the
horizon.</p>

<p>A storm, and the <i>Wireless</i> helpless&mdash;the
prospect was surely anything but pleasant.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />
<small>THE MYSTERIOUS POWER BOAT.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Jerusalem! if I owned that engine, George,
do you know what I&rsquo;d do with it?&rdquo; Nick was
heard to say, as the others drew near. &ldquo;Why,
I&rsquo;d take the first chance, when in touch with a
town, and sink her miles deep. Hang it, I&rsquo;d
be willing to contribute half the money I&rsquo;ve
got saved, to help get a new engine for the old
shaker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, I take you up on that offer,
Nick,&rdquo; George made answer, as quick as a
flash; &ldquo;because, to tell the honest truth, I&rsquo;m
getting weary of the cranky thing myself.
But that isn&rsquo;t going to help us any now. Lend
a hand here, and let&rsquo;s see what we can do to
mend matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on there, fellows,&rdquo; called out Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello! here&rsquo;s the commodore arrived,&rdquo;
George sang out, with a nervous little laugh.
&ldquo;Same old story, Jack; and blessed if I can
say how long it&rsquo;ll take to fix her up again, so
she&rsquo;ll do business. Might be ten minutes; and
again I&rsquo;m afraid it may be something serious
this time, that will keep me busy hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t stay out here all that time,
with a storm in prospect,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thunder! what&rsquo;s that you say?&rdquo; broke
from the perspiring skipper of the stalled
<i>Wireless</i>, as his head again bobbed up into
view, and he swept an anxious look in all
quarters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bank of clouds poking up over
yonder that may mean trouble,&rdquo; Jack went on
to say. &ldquo;So just get your stoutest cable
hitched to a cleat forward, and pass me the
other end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tow you, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Jack
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shucks! is that necessary?&rdquo; demanded the
proud George, with a slight frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sure is, for every furlong we cover now
brings us that much nearer a safe harbor; and
if those clouds are out for business, we&rsquo;ll need
all we can gain,&rdquo; Jack went on to insist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose I&rsquo;ll just have to,&rdquo; the other
continued; &ldquo;here, Nick, get out the hawser,
and I&rsquo;ll clamp it on to this cleat. But see here,
Jack, after you get started, Nick can keep
watch while I work at the engine, can&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing for him to do but hold the wheel
and keep straight after me. Perhaps when
the little <i>Tramp</i> does her prettiest, the two of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
us can keep going as fast as the <i>Comfort</i> goes;
and so nothing will have been lost after all,
George.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true; only I don&rsquo;t like it one little
bit,&rdquo; grunted George, as he commenced to
fasten one end of the hawser to the stout little
cleat&mdash;for, to tell the truth, George was a
mighty poor loser.</p>

<p>Once Jack had the other end of the line, he
made it secure to the stern of his own staunch
boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here goes now; look out!&rdquo; he warned, as
he started forward once more.</p>

<p>The three boats had been wallowing on the
heaving seas while power was shut off; but no
sooner did they pick up their course again,
than this sickening motion gave way to that of
progress.</p>

<p>George took off his coat, and got busy. He
was considerable of a mechanic, and at least
possessed the commendable trait of persistence.
Once he had started to do a thing he
never rested satisfied until it was accomplished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems like you&rsquo;re doing just as well pulling
that wreck as we are alone!&rdquo; called Herb
from the <i>Comfort</i>, which was not more than
fifty feet away.</p>

<p>George&rsquo;s head came into view above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
gunwale of the speed boat, but somehow this
time he was feeling quite too bad to take up
cudgels in defense of his craft. Besides, there
was truth in calling her a wreck just then. So
he ducked down once more and pretended not
to have heard the sarcastic allusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what I expected when I proposed to
tow George,&rdquo; Jack answered; and then he
turned the glasses ahead to a point that seemed
to interest him considerably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think that can be the place?&rdquo; asked Herb,
still watching him closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it is, yes, and hope so, too,&rdquo; came
the reply, together with a significant glance
upward to where the clouds were beginning to
shut out the sun, now on its way down the
western sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re edging in more?&rdquo; Herb continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; answered Jack; &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better
be as near land as we dare go. It may
mean a heap to us sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went on for some time, with things
seeming to be no different, only the clouds kept
covering the sky, making the water look dark
and forbidding. Indeed, all of the boys were
now considerably alarmed. The storm seemed
to be getting closer, and their haven had not
as yet hove in sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re coming down from
the north,&rdquo; explained Jack, when Nick called
out to mention this distressing fact. &ldquo;You
see, the trees all run together, and it&rsquo;s next
to impossible to tell where the mainland ends
off and the key begins. But I think I get the
dividing line through the glasses. Anyhow,
I&rsquo;m heading straight for it right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ten minutes later and Josh called out, to
say that he could see the opening all right;
and the others added their evidence to what
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the new breeze coming, Jack!&rdquo;
called Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the harbor is so close too,&rdquo; George
put in, as he arose from his lowly position.
&ldquo;But I reckon my engine will go now, Jack.
If you hear her crackle, please cast off that
hawser, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; sang out Jimmy, as he climbed forward,
Jack having taken the wheel himself
some little time previous, so as to be prepared
for any emergency that might arise.</p>

<p>A moment later and there was a merry popping
from the mended motor of the <i>Wireless</i>,
and immediately Jimmy heard this he cast the
rope loose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better make a plunge for it, George; I&rsquo;ll
stand by Herb!&rdquo; sang out Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But that wouldn&rsquo;t look right,&rdquo; objected
George, though doubtless he would feel better
satisfied if given a chance to make use of the
great speed his boat could show under special
conditions, in order to get in a harbor before
the blow struck them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rats! get along with you. We understand
what your feelings are; but we also know what
a cranky boat you&rsquo;ve got. Hit her up now,
and skedaddle!&rdquo; called Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you saying that as a chum, or as the
commodore of the fleet?&rdquo; asked George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the commodore; and see to it that you
obey orders,&rdquo; answered the other.</p>

<p>Accordingly, George did put his motor to
its best speed, and rapidly left them in the
lurch. Jack would never desert the steady
going old <i>Comfort</i>, and that wide-beamed
craft was already working her full limit of
nine miles to the hour, so nothing could be
done but keep moving, and hope for the best.</p>

<p>The wind increased. Luckily it was dead
ahead; and while it might retard their progress
to some extent, at the same time it did not
kick up half the tremendous sea that would
have been the case had it come from the wide
ocean at their back, or the port side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do ye be thinking we can make it?&rdquo; asked
Jimmy, who looked a little peaked as he squatted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
there, watching the tumbling waves, and
eying wistfully the shores now close at hand,
where houses were to be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it for a minute,&rdquo; answered
the resolute skipper of the <i>Tramp</i>, who always
refused to be downcast when face to face with
danger. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hitting up a pretty fair pace,
and if nothing happens to prevent, in ten minutes
we&rsquo;ll begin to get the benefit of the shelter
of the land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, George has gone through the
opening,&rdquo; declared Jimmy, hopefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, there he is beyant, and in calm
water; I do believe he&rsquo;s waiting for us right
now. Bully for George! And we ought to be
with him soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although the storm increased, they were by
now so well in that it had little terror for them.
And presently they ran into calmer waters,
where the other boat waited for their coming.</p>

<p>After that it did not take the boys long to
pick out a nook where they could be sheltered
to a great extent from the blow. And here
they anchored, very thankful because of their
safe arrival near Miami, after making such a
record run outside, where their boats looked
like tiny chips on the wide, heaving sea.</p>

<p>All of them were tired, and welcomed the
coming of night, when they could partake of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
supper, and perhaps gather around a camp-fire
ashore.</p>

<p>Jack had seen that there were quite a number
of other boats of all kinds scattered
around the bay. Some were anchored off cottages,
while others scudded for the home port
before the storm increased to violent proportions.
Although the time for West India hurricanes
was long since past, any blow along
the coast may mean peril to small craft, and
they considered it safer to get into shelter before
the worst came.</p>

<p>Jack was doing some little work aboard the
<i>Tramp</i> when a boat scraped alongside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as George climbed
aboard; &ldquo;what brings you over here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me have your glasses, won&rsquo;t you,
Jack?&rdquo; asked the other, mysteriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds mighty like you thought you
had made some discovery, George. Say, three
to one it&rsquo;s about that power boat that is a
ringer for the <i>Tramp</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go up head, Jack, because you&rsquo;ve guessed
it the first clat out of the box. Good for you!
Now I&rsquo;ll satisfy my mind about one thing, and
find out whether they are watching us every
time we happen to run together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the boat anchored away over
yonder, is it?&rdquo; Jack mused. &ldquo;For all we know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
it may belong to the Biscayne Bay Yacht Club,
and be at home right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh! just as I thought,&rdquo; grunted George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a feller sitting on deck right now,
and I&rsquo;ll be hanged if he hasn&rsquo;t got a pair of
marine glasses in his hands, leveled straight at
us. Didn&rsquo;t I tell you, Jack, there&rsquo;s something
mysterious about that boat? They are keeping
tabs on us right along. Perhaps they&rsquo;re
down here to follow us, though what for I declare
if I can guess. There, I guess he saw I
had a pair of glasses leveled at him, for he
dodged inside the cabin like a flash. Jack,
whatever can it mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me guessing, George, and I&rsquo;ll
have to pass,&rdquo; laughed the other, although admitting
to himself that the circumstances were
beginning to savor more of mystery than up to
now he had been willing to acknowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />
<small>NICK TRIES AGAIN.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Jimmy, strike up a bar of &lsquo;Nancy Lee,&rsquo; or
the &lsquo;Larboard Watch,&rsquo; while we&rsquo;re moving at
this snail&rsquo;s pace along this shallow shore, looking
for some nice place to camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Jimmy, just as Jack says; it
would sound right to hear music, for this is by
a long shot the dreariest place we&rsquo;ve struck
yet. Tune up your lyre, then, or your banjo&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t care which&mdash;and give us a song.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly, when thus pressed by the skipper,
not only of his own boat but Herb as well,
Jimmy reached in the cabin, and taking hold
of his never far distant banjo, commenced to
plunk away.</p>

<p>He had a fine mellow voice, and the rest of
the boys never tired of hearing him sing. All
of them joined in the chorus, though Josh
squeaked so that he would have killed the
whole melody, only that the volume of sound
was so great the discordant vein could not
easily be detected.</p>

<p>The three motor boats were almost drifting
along among the many keys bordering the extreme
southern shore of Florida; and the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
was just three days after we saw them reach
the vicinity of Miami.</p>

<p>They had passed from Cards Sound into
Barnes Sound, and marveled at the wonderful
construction of the concrete railway
arches, by means of which the East Coast Line
expected in the near future to reach far distant
Key West, passing from key to key the
entire distance, often over wide stretches of
open sea.</p>

<p>Cape Sable lay not a great distance ahead.
Once the little flotilla had rounded this tip end
of the peninsula, they would begin their northward
voyage.</p>

<p>The prospect for a camp ashore did not look
any too brilliant, and as the afternoon waned,
even sanguine Jack began to despair of finding
any solid ground. In all directions could
be seen the interminable mangrove islands,
where swamp abounded, and landing was next
to absurd.</p>

<p>When the wash of the sea proved too heavy
they had managed to keep some key between,
and thus far had come on without any accident.
Even George&rsquo;s eccentric motor had been
upon its best behavior, but none of them placed
much reliance upon it any longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tricky thing just seems to know when
to lay down and quit,&rdquo; grumbled Nick, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
George mustered up faith enough to actually
say a good word for the engine again. &ldquo;It
bides its time, and when we need it most of all,
it flunks. I&rsquo;m going to hold you to your word,
George, when we get to Tampa, where there&rsquo;s
a chance to pick up another machine to put in
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right!&rdquo; declared the other, &ldquo;since
you agreed to stand for half the expense, why
should I have any kick coming? Only I hope
the new engine can walk her along as good as
this one, when she feels like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang the speed part!&rdquo; cried Nick, again
rubbing himself as though his muscles were
becoming sore in a chronic way; &ldquo;if only the
plagued thing won&rsquo;t prove a quitter. I hate
anything that lies down on you, when you&rsquo;ve
gone and soaked your trust in it, that&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I see a place ahead that looks fairly
promising, mates,&rdquo; sang out Jack, at this point
in the discussion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Jack; take us to it right
away. I&rsquo;d give a heap just for a chance to get
out and just stand, without feeling my foundation
heave and wabble under me. Oh! if
only I had money enough to coax George to
buy a boat that would let a poor feller part his
hair on the side, like he used to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A short time later, and they ran in as near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the shore as was deemed advisable. Here they
anchored, with a friendly key protecting them
from any heavy sea that might come up from
the south.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where the homely little dinky is
worth its weight in gold,&rdquo; remarked Jack, as
he prepared to go ashore to look around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, only for that we&rsquo;d have to do the great
wading act right along; and it ain&rsquo;t always
convenient to get wet up to your waist,&rdquo; Herb
observed, in a satisfied tone.</p>

<p>Having taken in the prospect ashore, Jack
came back again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, fellows,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;High ground for half a mile inland, and if
the bugs allow, we can even sleep ashore
tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! that&rsquo;s grand news you&rsquo;re bringing
us, Commodore!&rdquo; cried Nick, looking
happy again. &ldquo;Now won&rsquo;t I get the kinks out
of my system, though? Last night aboard
nearly did for me, and that&rsquo;s no lie, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; George gave vent to one of his odd
grunts, adding: &ldquo;I reckon it was nearly the
end of me, for you kicked like a steer, and
came within an ace of smothering me the time
you rolled over, crowding me to the wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While they were thus joshing each other, all
hands were busily engaged getting such things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
aboard the little tenders as they knew they
would need for cooking supper ashore. If it
were later on decided to remain there during
the night, they could come out again to the
anchored motor boats, and secure blankets,
mosquito nets, and what other things were
required.</p>

<p>As usual, they commenced doing various
things, each according to his taste.</p>

<p>George had gone back again to his beloved
boat, doubtless to tinker with her eccentric
engine, which he always found a puzzle. Nick
wandered off along the shore, as though looking
for shells. Jimmy was pottering with
some of his strong fishing tackle as though he
had designs on the scaly denizens of Barnes
Sound, and intended putting out several night
set lines, if Jack could secure any mullet for
bait. Herb was stretching himself on the
sand, while Jack and Josh built a little fireplace
for cooking, making good use of some
blocks of coquina rock, a mixture of shells and
what looked like cement, and which underlies
much of the eastern shore of Florida.</p>

<p>Presently Jack saw Nick come breathlessly
back. He did not say a word to any one, but,
putting off in one of the dinkies, went aboard
the <i>Wireless</i>. Two minutes later he appeared
again, and Jack saw to his surprise that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
was trying to hide a piece of stout rope under
his coat.</p>

<p>Of course, his curiosity was aroused, but he
did not say anything either to Nick or the
others. The fat boy, casting a suspicious
glance around, and with a wide grin on his
face when he looked at Jimmy in particular,
again sauntered off. Jack noticed that when
he thought he had passed beyond their range
of vision, Nick actually started on a run. No
wonder he had seemed breathless when he
came in, if that was what he had been doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can the sly fellow be up to?&rdquo; Jack
said to himself. &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;d better keep
an eye open, for he&rsquo;s always so ready to
tumble into trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So as he worked alongside Jimmy, he kept
his eyes and ears on the alert. Perhaps fifteen
minutes passed. Then those in camp heard a
husky call that caused them to look up the
shore.</p>

<p>It chanced that there was a clump of mangroves
at the nearby point, and around this
Nick hove in sight. He seemed to have harnessed
himself in some fashion with the rope,
and was tugging with might and main.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what under the sun can he be doing?&rdquo;
ejaculated the surprised Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got something along, and seems to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
dragging it through the shallow water!&rdquo; Josh
declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And look at it splash, would you?&rdquo; Herb
went on. &ldquo;Say, d&rsquo;ye suppose, now, Nick&rsquo;s
gone and caught a turtle, one of those big loggerheads
they were telling us about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turtle nothing!&rdquo; laughed Jack; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a
fish!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fish!&rdquo; cried Jimmy, turning pale; &ldquo;do
ye mane to till me he&rsquo;s gone and caught a
<i>whale</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evidently Jimmy feared for his laurels; he
had held the position of top-notch in the competition
almost from the start, and was beginning
to believe that he might never be ousted
by the slow-moving fat boy. And hence the
sight of Nick deliberately dragging that immense
bulk behind him gave Jimmy a bad
sensation.</p>

<p>As the puffing Nick arrived alongside, it was
seen that he had indeed been dragging a tremendous
fish after him. The rope was twisted
under its gills in such a way that it could not
come loose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the dickens is it?&rdquo; demanded
Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blest if I know; but it&rsquo;s a <i>fish</i>, and that&rsquo;s
enough for me!&rdquo; announced the red-faced
captor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Be afther listening to him, now, bhoys,&rdquo;
observed Jimmy, looking dismayed; &ldquo;by the
pipers if he doesn&rsquo;t mane to claim he caught
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I do!&rdquo; exclaimed Nick, instantly;
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;d like to know how you&rsquo;re
going to knock me out of this, like you did that
shark. Here I go fastening on to all sorts of
big game, and you always want to question my
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of a fish is it, Jack?&rdquo; called
George, who was coming ashore to take a closer
look at the squirming victim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks squatty, like a big sea bass, the
kind we caught several times along the coast.
I rather think it&rsquo;s what they call a jewfish
down here,&rdquo; Jack replied, after looking the
prisoner over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good to eat?&rdquo; asked Nick, hungrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; they say so; and we&rsquo;ll take a chunk
out of him to try,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s answer.
&ldquo;Where did you get him, Nick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up the shore a little ways. Do I have to
tell just how, Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See him try to back out,&rdquo; jeered the envious
Jimmy, as his eyes took in the enormous
bulk of the prize, and he mentally figured that
it must weigh all of two hundred pounds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
against which his bass of fifteen must look like
a baby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we want to know everything, so begin,&rdquo;
declared George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, when I was walking along, I discovered
this silly thing splashing like Sam Hill
close to the shore. He must have been left
by the tide, and was half stranded between
two bunches of coquina rock. I had a sudden
wild idea, and hurried back here to get a
rope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why you wanted it, was it?&rdquo; cried
George. &ldquo;I was a little afraid you might be
thinking of hanging yourself; but then I expected
the rope would break if you tried that.
But go on, Nick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there ain&rsquo;t much to tell, for I just harnessed
the old chap up like you see, worked
him loose from the rocky wedge, and dragged
him to camp. But I hope now, after all my
hard work, you ain&rsquo;t going to say I didn&rsquo;t
catch that fish. Anyway, our rules read so
long as a feller gets the game by fair means,
and without help. Here he is, and you can rig
up some sort of scales to weigh him. What&rsquo;s
a few pounds, more or less, among friends?
But what do you say, Jack, Herb, Josh and
George?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, according to the letter of the rules,
you win,&rdquo; Jack remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct,&rdquo; ventured Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He lost one whopper because he had to
have help; but that can&rsquo;t be said about this
prize. Nick, you certainly take the cake,&rdquo;
Herb chuckled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree with the rest; he deserves all he
gets,&rdquo; said George.</p>

<p>Jimmy shrugged his shoulders, and made a
grimace, as he observed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, I do belave the lot of ye are set agin
me; but, honest to Injun, in me own hearrt I
do be thinkin&rsquo; the same. Which laves me a
bad second in the race. But I do not despair
of batin&rsquo; him out yet. Just give me toime,
bhoys, give me toime to get me wits together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack busied himself rigging up a crude
scales, whereby two of them could stand out
against the big fish; and in this way it was
finally estimated that Nick&rsquo;s latest capture
weighed about two hundred and thirty pounds.</p>

<p>The fat boy was in high glee over his adventure,
and burst out into frequent boasts.
He took especial pains to let Jimmy know that
the one who laughed last always laughed
hardest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just wait, and say how that same turns
out,&rdquo; declared the Irish lad, seemingly only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the more determined to exceed Nick&rsquo;s big
score.</p>

<p>So the afternoon passed away, and it came
on toward evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello! how&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; remarked Jack, who
had been out with George for some time, taking
a look at his motor, and consulting as to
the wisdom of making a radical change when
they reached the city of Tampa; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s coming
on night, and I don&rsquo;t see any signs of supper
in sight. And by the way, where is Josh; I
don&rsquo;t happen to set eyes on him around?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others stared at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I remember now, that he asked me
for the loan of my gun some little while back,
and said he&rsquo;d like to take a stroll down the
beach, thinking there might be a bunch of
those nice little shore birds on some mud flat,
that he could bring back with him,&rdquo; Herb
said, looking perplexed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long ago was that?&rdquo; Jack demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess all of an hour; just after you went
out when George called.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has anybody heard a shot?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>

<p>But nobody had; and, as the night came on,
the five boys began to realize that something
must surely have happened to their lengthy
chum.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />
<small>THE LOST CHUM.</small></h2>


<p>Uneasiness increased as the shadows of
night began to fall around them; and the
motor boat boys cast many anxious glances
toward the gloomy patches of mangroves along
the shore, as well as the denser sawgrass,
dwarf palmetto and trees that covered the
mainland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this at all,&rdquo; Jack finally declared.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve shouted enough for any one
with ears, within half a mile, to have heard
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And never had a peep from Josh, that&rsquo;s a
fact,&rdquo; declared Nick, whose cheeks had lost
some of their customary color, in the face of
this mystery; for he was very fond of the absent
chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever could have happened to the
lad?&rdquo; asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems hard to believe that he could have
lost himself, and wandered so far away that
he couldn&rsquo;t fire his gun, or hear us yell,&rdquo; Herb
observed, frowning.</p>

<p>George plucked at the sleeve of Jack, as he
remarked in a low, nervous tone:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you don&rsquo;t believe <i>they</i> could have had
anything to do with our chum&rsquo;s disappearance,
do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the wide world are you speaking
about?&rdquo; demanded the other, startled for the
moment by the grave way in which George
said this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you know, that queer lot in the boat
that was a ringer for the <i>Tramp</i>,&rdquo; was what
George added, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! come now, what put that silly notion
in your head?&rdquo; asked Jack; though at the
same time he could not but weigh the startling
proposition advanced by George in his mind,
and find himself impressed more or less by its
possibility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; George went on, &ldquo;because, for
the life of me, I just can&rsquo;t imagine any other
reason why the fellow wouldn&rsquo;t do <i>something</i>
to let us know he was alive. If he discovered
that he was lost, I&rsquo;m dead sure Josh would
have sense enough to holler, and fire his gun
several times in succession.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we never heard the first sign,&rdquo; declared
Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve just stood it as long as I mean
to,&rdquo; declared Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; let&rsquo;s get busy and do something,&rdquo;
George burst out with, for he was ever an impetuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
fellow, eager to be accomplishing
things, and getting to his intended goal by a
short-cut, if possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack, say what, and we&rsquo;ll stand by you,&rdquo;
Herb spoke up, with a look of grim determination
on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s my sentiments!&rdquo; affirmed Jimmy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say the word, and we&rsquo;ll all back you up,
Commodore!&rdquo; Nick put in, puffing his cheeks
out, and looking very fierce&mdash;for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s an old saying, you remember,&rdquo;
Jack remarked, &ldquo;to the effect that if the
mountain won&rsquo;t come to you, the next best
thing is to go to the mountain. And if Josh
hangs fire about returning to camp, why, some
of us have got to get a hustle on, and look him
up. That&rsquo;s plain enough, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sure is; and we expect you to be the one
to lead the rescue party, Jack,&rdquo; George declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right; and as there&rsquo;s no time to be lost,
let&rsquo;s get busy. Somebody has to stay here,
and guard the camp; and I appoint Nick as
the fellow to take that duty on his shoulders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Jack made this declaration, Nick
started, and seemed to shiver a little; but, realizing
that all eyes were turned toward him,
he braced up again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! all right, Jack, just as you say,&rdquo; he
expressed himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Understand,&rdquo; Jack explained, seeing that
the fat boy felt hurt; &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t because there&rsquo;s
any doubt about your courage and all that; but
none of us can say how far we may have to
tramp, or what swamps we&rsquo;ll have to wade
through; and you admit, Nick, that you&rsquo;re not
fitted for campaigning in that line as well as
some of the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know that,&rdquo; said Nick, heaving a
sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Jack, as though he had
had a second thought, &ldquo;as three of us ought
to be enough, I guess I&rsquo;ll leave a second guard
behind. Herb, would you mind staying, to
keep Nick company? It&rsquo;s just as much a post
of honor as going with George, Jimmy and
myself. And you&rsquo;ll have to keep watch all the
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m ready to do just what you say,
Jack. I believe you know best; and while of
course I&rsquo;d rather be with the hunting party,
count on me holding up the other end with
Nick here,&rdquo; Herb hastened to declare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; Jack went on, relieved
to find that his plans were meeting with
next to no opposition. &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll have
your gun, while each of us will go armed; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
there&rsquo;s no telling what we may meet up with.
I&rsquo;ll take the rifle, while George and Jimmy
have the scatter-guns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if you find Josh, how will you let
us know?&rdquo; Herb asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fire six shots at regular intervals of
about two seconds apart. Be sure to count
them carefully if you hear any firing, because
in case we meet up with a prowling panther,
or anything like that, the shooting would be
more rapid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Jack mentioned that one word &ldquo;panther,&rdquo;
it might have been observed that Nick&rsquo;s
mouth opened, as if sudden dismay had seized
hold upon him. However, once more he summoned
his nerve to the fore, and shut his teeth
hard together. It was Herb, fortunately, who
advanced the proposition that must have been
buzzing in the brain of the more timid Nick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After you&rsquo;ve gone, Jack, perhaps it would
be just as well for Nick and myself to go
aboard the boats, and hold the fort there.
We&rsquo;ll make sure to keep the fire burning all
the while, so you&rsquo;ll have a signal on the shore,
to tell where we are. Is that right, fellows?&rdquo;
he remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best thing you could do; and I was just
going to say something like that,&rdquo; was the way
Jack put it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>George had made haste to secure the guns,
and each of the three now held a weapon in
his hands. They looked very warlike and
grim, as the camp-fire shone on the polished
steel; and Nick could, after all, be pardoned
for showing signs of excitement as they prepared
to start off. For Nick was in the main
a peaceable lad, who liked not strife under any
conditions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;d better give one more halloo
before we go?&rdquo; suggested George; for the idea
of tramping into that mysterious wilderness,
with its swamps and unknown perils, was not
to be treated lightly as a picnic, by any means.</p>

<p>So they all raised their voices, and sent out
a series of whoops that might have made any
Indian warrior envious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; cried Jack, after this had gone on
for a full minute.</p>

<p>The last echo had died away, and complete
silence followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never a thing!&rdquo; exclaimed George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! hark! what is that?&rdquo; cried Nick,
eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only an owl far away, answering us,&rdquo; Jack
declared, promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must think we&rsquo;re trying to give him the
laugh,&rdquo; Herb remarked; although he was feeling
in anything but a joking mood, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
strange disappearance of Josh weighing on
his mind so heavily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys,&rdquo; Jack called out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got the lantern lighted, and we&rsquo;ll try our luck
following his trail as long as we are able to
see it. Oh! and Herb, if you and Nick want,
you might as well eat something while we&rsquo;re
gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nixy for me,&rdquo; Herb made answer. &ldquo;My
appetite seems to have gone up the flue. But
we could be cooking something, in case you
found Josh, and all came in hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Nick hastened to add.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll give us something to keep our minds
busy, and that means a whole lot. Good-bye,
boys; and the best of luck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We sure hope you find our chum, safe and
sound,&rdquo; Herb added, feelingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thing more,&rdquo; Jack went on to say;
&ldquo;If Josh should happen in while we&rsquo;re gone,
you&rsquo;ll want to let us know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that,&rdquo;
said Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then listen. Fire both barrels of your gun,
about two seconds apart. Then repeat the volley
twice more, making six shots in all. We&rsquo;ll
understand what you want to tell us, and that
we&rsquo;re needed here. That&rsquo;s all. Come on,
George and Jimmy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick watched them pass away, and the face
of the fat boy told that his soul was troubled.
Yet it was not so much of himself he thought,
but the strange mystery hovering over this
vanishing of Josh.</p>

<p>Jack knew where the long-legged would-be
hunter had last been seen, and accordingly he
made direct for that spot.</p>

<p>Evidently he had no especial trouble in discovering
the tracks left by the heels of Josh&rsquo;s
shoes, for those left behind saw the trio move
directly away. Soon the flitting glimmer of
the moving lantern vanished entirely among
the thickets covering the land in places.</p>

<p>Josh had headed down the shore when he
went forth to try and add to the camp larder
by knocking down a bunch of the tasty little
snipe and other shore birds, flocks of which
were seen whenever the tide changed, and the
mud flats became partly bare.</p>

<p>That meant he had gone west, for the boys
had fallen into the habit of saying &ldquo;down&rdquo;
as long as they were headed south; and until
they turned up the coast it would continue
that way.</p>

<p>Jack led with his lantern, and carrying the
rifle in his other hand. For some little time
the three boys kept on this way. When the
tracks became harder to see, Jack used his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
judgment, and managed to pick up the trail
again every time.</p>

<p>All the while George and Jimmy were casting
uneasy looks ahead. The moon being past
its prime, would not rise for some time; and
as a consequence all was pitch darkness around
them. It was easy to imagine all sorts of
perils lurking in that gloom beyond. Every
simple little sound, such as a stray &rsquo;coon scampering
away at the coming of the swinging
light, caused them a new quiver.</p>

<p>George could not get that strange motor
boat out of his mind. He believed that it had
left Miami ahead of them, for it was gone on
the morning after their arrival. And the
chances were that it had come down here ahead
of them.</p>

<p>Having more or less of a vivid imagination,
George was picturing all sorts of strange
things as happening. He even looked back
along the career of their chum, Josh, trying
to figure out some romantic reason for
these people on the strange craft to want to
kidnap the long-legged youth.</p>

<p>Despite his best efforts, however, this was
pretty much a failure. There never was a fellow
with more of an ordinary every-day past
than the said Josh. George had known him
since they were kids together, first starting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
in to school. His father was one of the substantial
men of the town; and, so far as George
knew, there had never been even the faintest
rumor of anything singular attaching to the
Purdue family.</p>

<p>So George, baffled in this respect, had to
give it up, and confess himself altogether at
sea. But if Josh had simply gone and lost
himself, then why had he not answered their
shouts?</p>

<p>They had now been following the trail of
the missing chum quite some time, and found
themselves at a considerable distance from
camp. Every now and then, apparently, Josh
had made his way to the shore, to find out
whether there were any flocks of birds in
sight; but as he still kept moving on, he evidently
met with disappointment.</p>

<p>That he continued to wander on was evidence
of a determination to find some sort of
game. Josh was not much of a hunter, and
he did hate to be unmercifully guyed by Jimmy
and Nick, whenever he came back empty
handed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be long now, before we make some
sort of discovery,&rdquo; George finally remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; Jack said, over his
shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How far are we from camp now, Jack?&rdquo;
continued the skipper of the <i>Wireless</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps a mile, more or less,&rdquo; answered
the pilot of the expedition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not so far as to be beyond the sound
of the yell we put up, eh?&rdquo; continued George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless Josh suddenly became stone deaf,
he must have heard us,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here; you&rsquo;ve got something on your
mind; why not share it with us, Jack? You&rsquo;re
bothered about something, too. If it don&rsquo;t
take in those queer acting fellows on the power
boat, what does ail you?&rdquo; and George caught
hold of his chum as the other arose from examining
the trail once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know as there could be anything
in it,&rdquo; Jack admitted, slowly, as if loth
to air his secret fears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But tell us what you do think, even if it
does seem impossible, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only this, that if our chum chanced to slip
into some muck bed, he might have been sucked
down in the slimy stuff before he could even
shout for help,&rdquo; was the gruesome remark
to which Jack gave utterance.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />
<small>TRACKED TO THE BAYOU.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Oh! I hope it won&rsquo;t turn out as bad as that,
Jack!&rdquo; gasped George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor spalpeen!&rdquo; whimpered Jimmy,
apparently shocked by what their leader had
just remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Jack hastened to say, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make
up your minds, boys, that Josh has run against
that sort of a hard deal, just because it flashed
into my mind. You wanted to know why I
was in such a sweat, and I told you. But,
honest Injun, after I&rsquo;ve spoken my mind, I
just can&rsquo;t bring myself to believe it. We&rsquo;ll
find our chum, sooner or later. Perhaps, after
all, it&rsquo;ll turn out that he had a bad tumble,
and hurt himself so he wasn&rsquo;t able to let us
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as long as we&rsquo;re able to follow his
trail, we hadn&rsquo;t ought to give up in despair,&rdquo;
George asserted, very sensibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, we&rsquo;ve shown in the past that we&rsquo;re
not built that way,&rdquo; Jimmy thought fit to remark,
firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s be going on,&rdquo; Jack wound up
the conference by saying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>For the fifth time the trail approached the
water again. Josh evidently hated to give up
the idea that had been in his mind when he
left camp. If there were any of those dainty
little shore birds to be had, he wanted to get
a crack at the same; though by this time he
must have become aware of the fact that he
was wandering much farther away than he had
intended doing in the start.</p>

<p>This time there happened to be quite a deep-seated
cove, with a point of land running out
that would completely shut out all sight of the
spot where the three motor boats were anchored,
with the camp-fire ashore.</p>

<p>Jack noted this fact; somehow it was impressed
on his mind, though he could not have
exactly explained why this should be so, had
he been asked.</p>

<p>The tracks grew fainter, so that it was only
by pushing the glowing and useful lantern
down close to the sand that Jack was able to
follow the line by which Josh had pushed his
way along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is where he dropped on his knees, the
better to crawl forward,&rdquo; whispered the guide;
and both George and Jimmy could make out
the deeper impressions that undoubtedly must
have been made by a pair of knees pressing
down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a screen of saw palmetto in front
of them, hiding the water. Perhaps Josh had
discovered a flock of the coveted birds on a
bar, and was making his way to a point he
had in mind, where he might suddenly rise,
and fire. But something must have prevented
his carrying out this plan, then, for certainly
the sound of a heavy shotgun charge could
have been heard at the camp, had he pulled
trigger. &ldquo;Wait here for me, and keep quiet,&rdquo;
whispered Jack, as, leaving the lantern on the
ground, he started away.</p>

<p>His two companions were rendered almost
speechless by his strange action. They could
only stare at each other, and nod their heads,
as though striving in this way to communicate
their fears.</p>

<p>In two minutes Jack came back. He looked
disappointed as he stooped to pick up the lantern
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing, boys,&rdquo; he said, quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem to be, and that&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo;
mumbled Jimmy, much depressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here, what did you expect to find when
you went on there?&rdquo; demanded George, immediately
suspicious. &ldquo;Was it anything about
that bally old boat, the one that&rsquo;s been dogging
us all the way down from Jacksonville? Tell
me that, Jack, old top!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! perhaps it may be the people aboard
that same boat have come to the conclusion
<i>we&rsquo;re</i> doing the dogging. They run across us
in all sorts of unexpected places. And if you
stop to remember, George, it&rsquo;s the other boat
that has always slipped away secretly, not us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, it was,&rdquo; George flashed up;
&ldquo;but you didn&rsquo;t answer my question, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I did have your pet hobby in mind
when I went on just now, to take a look at
this fine little lagoon; because, with that point
of land standing in a half-moon curve, it looks
like a splendid harbor for small boats. And,
to tell you the truth, I picked up the butt end
of a cigarette just back there five feet, one that
was thrown away recently, because no rain or
dew had fallen on it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew! now, that does look suspicious, I
must say,&rdquo; George exclaimed, in a low and
cautious voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t a sign of any boat in the
bayou, as far as I could see,&rdquo; Jack went on.
&ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s so dark now that I wasn&rsquo;t
able to take in the whole bay; but, anyhow,
there isn&rsquo;t a light visible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, what nixt?&rdquo; asked Jimmy, eager
to get at the solution of this perplexing problem,
which was thrilling their nerves more and
more as they made progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>For answer, Jack moved forward, this time
using the friendly lantern as before. Brushing
through the screen of saw palmettos, they
could see the water lapping the shore of the
lagoon, though there were still bushes and tall
grass between.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uttering this exclamation half under his
breath, the leader of the trio suddenly came
to a halt. Jimmy half raised the gun he was
carrying, as though under the impression that
they were about to be confronted by something,
either a human enemy or one in the way
of a wild beast, that would bar their further
progress.</p>

<p>Then he saw that Jack, instead of showing
signs of preparing for battle, was on his knees,
eagerly examining certain marks in the sand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you found?&rdquo; asked George, in
an awed tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As near as I can make out, there are tracks
that seem to tell of a scuffle!&rdquo; was the ready
reply, as Jack pointed here and there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the great horn spoon, but I believe
you&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; gasped George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s either that, now, or else the gossoon&rsquo;s
been and had a fit,&rdquo; Jimmy declared, though
he could not remember that Josh had ever been
addicted to such things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No; there have been two men here,&rdquo; said
Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glory be!&rdquo; ejaculated the Irish lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us how you know that, Jack?&rdquo; asked
George, his face struggling between a grin and
a look of alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s as plain as print; and if you
look here, you&rsquo;ll see the marks of their shoes.
Both seem much larger than Josh ever made,
and yet they are different, for one had heels,
and the other must have been wearing some
sort of moccasin, perhaps the kind I&rsquo;ve got, to
be used aboard a small, varnished decked boat,
so as to avoid scratching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say so?&rdquo; burst out George, unable
to hold in any longer. &ldquo;After this you
won&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m off my base when I mention
my suspicions about fellows who run away in
the night, peek through marine glasses at us
every chance they get, and just act like a parcel
of sneaks. Jack, that fly-up-the-creek
power boat must have been in this bayou when
our chum came crawling through these bushes,
and took a look out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about what I&rsquo;m thinking, now,&rdquo;
admitted the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the men happened to be ashore,
and saw him spying on the boat? Is that in
line with what you think, Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks that way. Two unknown parties
certainly dropped down on Josh while he was
lying here. He put up as good a fight as he
could, but they were too much for the poor
fellow,&rdquo; Jack went on, looking as though he
might be reading all these things from the
marks upon the sand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t say any signs of blood, do
ye, Jack darlint?&rdquo; asked Jimmy, with a plain
vein of horror in his quavering voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m glad to say I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the
other. &ldquo;So, on that account it would seem
that the fellows haven&rsquo;t actually hurt Josh,
only made him a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jimmy gave a bleat, not unlike the pitiful
sound a distressed goat might emit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Och! thin the bally rascals have carried
him away wid them, and we&rsquo;ll niver set eyes
on our chum agin. Whirra! whativer will
Nick do about his rations, if the cook of the
bunch be lost, strayed or stolen?&rdquo; he whimpered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nick be hanged!&rdquo; said George, vehemently,
though in a low tone; &ldquo;never fear but he&rsquo;ll
get all he wants to eat. What we have to find
out is where they&rsquo;ve gone, and why they dared
carry Josh Purdue away with them. And
we&rsquo;ll just do that same, if it takes the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of the winter. You hear me speaking, don&rsquo;t
you? Oh! what did you do that for, Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This last sentence was caused by a sudden
action on the part of Jack. He had raised the
lantern, and with a quick, downward motion
caused the light to go out&mdash;a trick readily
learned by any one who will take the trouble
to experiment. And thus they were left standing
there in the dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How under the sun did it happen that none
of us saw it before?&rdquo; Jack was softly saying,
in a vexed tone, as though he had made a discovery
that agitated him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saw what?&rdquo; asked George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bend your head this way, and look yonder
through the bushes,&rdquo; Jack told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great governor!&rdquo; whispered the <i>Wireless</i>
skipper, hoarsely; &ldquo;it <i>is</i> a light, as sure as
shooting! And on the water, too, Jack. Say,
that power boat must be over there, in another
bayou just beyond. There&rsquo;s a neck of land
runs out, and it&rsquo;s covered with trees and scrub.
That&rsquo;s why we didn&rsquo;t glimpse that light before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit the nail on the head, George,
for that&rsquo;s just the way the land lies,&rdquo; Jack
went on, trying to control his voice, which
would tremble a little despite his utmost endeavors.
&ldquo;But perhaps that light wasn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
shining a bit ago. There, look! it&rsquo;s disappeared
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it has,&rdquo; Jimmy observed, having
been an interested observer all the while;
&ldquo;just for all the worrld loike a windy had been
opened, and shut again. I do be thinking mesilf
that somebody was afther coming out of
the cabin to take a look around, and lift the
door open the while, that&rsquo;s all. Now he&rsquo;s gone
in again, by the same token.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope, then, he didn&rsquo;t just catch a glimpse
of our light moving, before I doused the glim,&rdquo;
was the fervent wish expressed by Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly think he did, Jack,&rdquo; George said,
nervously. &ldquo;You see, it was standing on the
ground up to the time you grabbed it up again.
But what ought we do now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make our way around that tongue of land
the best way we can, and see how things are
there,&rdquo; Jack replied, without the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not follow the beach around?&rdquo;
George suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, that wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad scheme. It&rsquo;s
so dark that if we kept low, they couldn&rsquo;t see
us moving. And, besides, it&rsquo;ll save a lot of
scrambling through that brush, without the
help of the lantern. All right; come along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
then, boys. And let&rsquo;s remember to keep as
quiet as an owl in the daytime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saying this in a whisper, Jack led the way,
the others following along in Indian file at
his heels. Whenever he halted for any reason,
both George and Jimmy would also draw
up instantly. And no doubt, on every occasion
of this sort, their excited pulses would
cause their hearts to beat like trip-hammers.</p>

<p>Just as they had guessed, there was a point
of land running out all of seventy feet into
the water, and hiding the next bayou. Sometimes
these extend from the main Florida
shore around Barnes Sound like the fingers of
a human hand. Again they will be in the form
of reefs, composed of small, sharp-edged &rsquo;coon
oysters, that stick up out of the salt water at
low tide, but are entirely submerged when the
flood comes on.</p>

<p>Before reaching the extreme point, Jack
concluded that it would be wise for them to
pass over here, rather than risk discovery by
going to the limit of the cape; where, with
the white sand to serve as a background to
their darker bodies, some one on the watch
might discover their approach, and give warning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack, I see it!&rdquo; whispered George, presently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The boat, you mean,&rdquo; replied the other, in
the same guarded tone. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve caught her,
too. But everything seems to be dark around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder now, have they deserted the ould
craft,&rdquo; suggested Jimmy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so loud, Jimmy; we&rsquo;ve got to find that
out for ourselves,&rdquo; Jack went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By going aboard, you mean, don&rsquo;t you,
Jack?&rdquo; from eager George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other way; and if these people
are holding our chum a prisoner, we&rsquo;ve just
got to let them know we object to such a high-handed
business. Are you both willing to
stand back of me, George, Jimmy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every time,&rdquo; George replied; and Jack
could easily imagine how his excitable chum
must be nerved up to the highest tension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye c&rsquo;n count on me, through thick and
thin, sink or shwim, survive or perish,&rdquo; Jimmy
put in, as solemnly as though he might be holding
up his hand, and subscribing to the oath
before the court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then come on, and we&rsquo;ll take the bull by
the horns,&rdquo; said Jack, moving forward
through the thin growth that marked the spit
of land near its terminus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s forget, fellows, that we&rsquo;re
armed to the teeth,&rdquo; whispered George, as he
set out to trail close behind his leader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>In this manner, then, the three motor boat
boys crawled across to the shore of the other
little bayou, bent upon making a bold move
looking to rescuing their comrade, if so be
Josh were found to be a prisoner in the hands
of the strangers.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a><br />
<small>FOR THE SAKE OF CHUM JOSH.</small></h2>


<p>It seemed to Jack Stormways that all his
senses must be on the alert as never before.
Even the slightest sound caught his attention&mdash;the
rustling of a prowling &rsquo;coon through
the saw palmetto scrub; the splash of some
fish jumping out of the water of the lagoon;
and from a distance came strange, querulous
noises which he guessed must proceed from
some bird roost, situated in the depths of a
swamp, although Jack knew very little about
such places from actual experience.</p>

<p>Having passed partly over the point of land,
they could just begin to make out the boat that
lay in the next bayou. And George&rsquo;s imagination
worked overtime, so that he was positive
he could recognize the familiar outlines
of the craft that looked like the <i>Tramp</i>.</p>

<p>Once Jack came to a stop. Possibly he only
meant to take an observation, in order to make
sure that the coast was clear; but the other
boys at once jumped to the conclusion that
he had seen some sign of trouble ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; whispered George, making a
nervous forward thrust with his gun, as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
eager to mix up, if so be one came along; while
Jimmy edged up on the other side, quivering
with anxiety, too.</p>

<p>Jack bent his head lower before making a
reply; for he knew the danger of allowing his
voice to rise above the faintest murmur. The
lapping of the waves on the sandy beach close
by, together with those strange sounds from
the interior, might go far toward muffling
speech, but if suspicious ears were on the alert
it were folly to take unnecessary chances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing. I was only looking. All seems
quiet, boys, so come on,&rdquo; he said; and no doubt
the throbbing hearts of the other lads eased
down in the strain.</p>

<p>So once more they started to advance, with
the border of the lagoon now close at hand.
All of them could by this time make out the
fact that the boat must be anchored in shallow
water near the shore. Perhaps those aboard
had neglected to provide themselves with a
dinky; and in consequence had to rely upon
finding some place where they could push the
power boat in, by loosening the anchor cable.</p>

<p>The light breeze that caused the waves to
gently roll up on the sand was coming from
the southwest. Hence it was that the boat
lay almost stern on, showing part of her starboard
quarter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>When they had reached a point close to the
water&rsquo;s edge, the three boys again instinctively
came to a halt, to once more scrutinize the
craft.</p>

<p>No lantern hung there to serve as a riding
light; it was not needed, as would have been
the case in a crowded harbor. Faint, indeed,
the chance of any other boat running them
down here in this secluded spot.</p>

<p>George had unconsciously laid a hand on
the arm of Jack as they thus crouched and
gazed. His fingers suddenly tightened their
hold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;did you see that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Sh!&rdquo; breathed Jack, hastily. &ldquo;Yes, I
was watching. Some one brushed aside the
curtain that covers the cabin bullseye, and
light shone through. That settles one thing,
George.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That they&rsquo;re aboard!&rdquo; echoed the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, we go on, don&rsquo;t we, Jack?&rdquo; begged
the impetuous George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say, yes; for we believe our chum
is being held a prisoner on that same boat.
Make your mind easy, both of you; it isn&rsquo;t
going to get away from us now. We&rsquo;ve gone
too far to hold back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; whispered the delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
George; while Jimmy muttered his assent,
which was none the less fervent because the
words were inaudible.</p>

<p>Once before, on a cruise the motor boys were
making on the waters of the faraway North,
they had had a stirring encounter with some
lawless men who were fleeing from officers sent
to apprehend them. On that occasion Jack
and his chums had managed to give considerable
assistance to the legal authorities; and it
was largely through their work that the fugitives
were finally apprehended.</p>

<p>No doubt this circumstance must have
loomed up large in the memory of George
right then and there. He had long ago made
up his mind that the mysterious persons on
board the boat that looked like the <i>Tramp</i> were
a couple of rascals, who felt afraid of the
cruisers for some reason or other. And now,
that it seemed they had set upon poor Josh,
making him prisoner, and carrying him
aboard, the conditions became darker than
ever.</p>

<p>It was the greatest mystery the boys had
ever struck. Even Jack, with his usual keen
intellect, was utterly unable to determine what
these men could want with the missing crew
of the <i>Comfort</i>; Josh, a fellow who seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
made enemies among his companions, and simply
devoid of evil intent.</p>

<p>Perhaps they had discovered him creeping
through the scrub, either to get a shot at some
shore birds or to examine the anchored power
boat, in which he knew George at least was
deeply interested. If they were men fleeing
from the sheriff, his actions might have looked
so suspicious to them that they were impelled
to pounce on him without giving warning.</p>

<p>Many were the explanations that surged
through the excited brains of the three lads
in the brief space of time occupied in reaching
the shore of the second lagoon.</p>

<p>As they stood there, George and Jimmy content
to follow the lead of Jack, no matter what
that might mean, a low murmur came to them.
It was as if those inside the cabin of the boat
might be conversing among themselves.</p>

<p>Jack listened intently. Perhaps he even
entertained a faint hope that he might hear
the high-pitched voice of Josh above the rest;
for the tall boy had a way of using the rising
inflection when in the least excited. But the
fact of the cabin being closed prevented his
discovering any marked difference between the
tones of those who were speaking.</p>

<p>George and Jimmy were waiting to see what
means their leader would adopt, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
gain the deck of the little craft. The boat lay
at a distance of perhaps twenty feet from the
edge of the water. Judging from the fact
that the beach was sandy there could be no
question but what, if they picked their way,
they might be able to wade out, without getting
in any deeper than hip-high at most.</p>

<p>When Jack hesitated for that half minute,
with the little waves crawling up to his feet,
it was because he wished to make sure that
there was no one upon the stern of the swinging
power boat, to discover their advance.</p>

<p>Having made sure of this fact, he would
boldly push forward, entering the water, regardless
of the fact that their shoes must suffer
in consequence.</p>

<p>When he took the first step, the others were
alongside. They fancied that the time had
gone by for them to follow <i>after</i> Jack; if a
battle were imminent, their place must be on
the firing line, where numbers would count for
something. For did they not grip weapons
as well as Jack; and were they not just as anxious
to effect the rescue of their missing chum?</p>

<p>Once Jimmy stumbled, and made quite a
little splash ere he recovered his footing. It
may have been a jellyfish upon which he placed
his foot, and which caused him to slide; or
some obstacle in the shape of a clump of &rsquo;coon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
oysters. The cause was immaterial; but what
splash he made gave them all a thrill, since
they fully expected that it would bring about
discovery.</p>

<p>At the time it chanced that they had passed
over more than half the distance separating
them from the boat, and were standing up to
their knees in the water.</p>

<p>Jack noted that the murmurous sound which
they had decided must be the mingling of
voices, had suddenly stopped. From this he
imagined that those within the closed cabin
of the power boat had heard the splash and
were waiting for a repetition of the same, in
order to gauge its meaning.</p>

<p>Would they come out to investigate? If so,
what should be the programme of the three
who stood there in the water? None of them
had ever fired a shot at a human being in all
their lives; and the mere thought of such a
thing was distasteful to them. At the same
time, if their comrade were in the hands of
unscrupulous men, and heroic measures had
to be adopted in order to effect his release,
not one of them would hesitate.</p>

<p>Jack often looked back to that strained
moment, when he and his comrades stood
there, knee deep in the lagoon, within a dozen
feet of the mysterious little power boat, keyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
up to a condition when their nerves were all
on edge, and waiting for whatever might happen.
He could feel a sense of amusement over
it, too, at some future time; but it was certainly
no laughing matter then.</p>

<p>Then there suddenly flashed out a broad
beam of light. The door of the cabin had been
opened; and, as those standing there in the
water were directly behind the stern, the light
fell full upon them.</p>

<p>Jack saw a figure push into view. Outlined
against the lighted interior of the boat it stood
up in plain sight, and they could even make
out the fact that the unknown party wore
knickerbockers, as though dressed for an outing.</p>

<p>Of course he must have discovered the
threatening trio there just as soon as he thus
partly emerged from the cabin. They could
tell this from the way in which he stood as
if riveted to the spot, making no motion either
to advance further, or retreat back into the
recesses of the boat&rsquo;s interior.</p>

<p>Jack did not mean to give him a chance to
take the initiative. He raised his gun, and
immediately covered the unknown party;
which action was accepted as proof by his two
chums that they were to follow suit, and they
proceeded to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>If astonishment had held the man motionless
up to this moment, a due sense of caution
kept him so after he discovered those three
menacing guns turned full in his direction.
Apparently he must be either stunned by the
situation that had burst upon him without
warning; or else he kept his head, and knew
there was only one thing to do in order to avoid
trouble, which was to submit to the inevitable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of trying to drop back into
that cabin,&rdquo; said Jack, in a voice that was
quite stern, even if it did quiver a little;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got you covered all right, and you
might as well surrender!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ticket!&rdquo; rasped George, trying
to seem very formidable, in order to hide the
fact that his knees were knocking together
just a trifle, with excitement of course, not
fear!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />
<small>ABOARD THE STRANGE POWER BOAT.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Well, this <i>is</i> a rich joke!&rdquo; laughed the
man. &ldquo;Just keep your fingers from pressing
those triggers, please, boys. No danger of my
trying the disappearing act. Fact is, we&rsquo;ve
been expecting you to come along for some
time now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack was not going to allow himself to be
deceived. &ldquo;Soft words buttered no parsnips,&rdquo;
he had often heard his mother say; and because
this unknown fellow chose to talk
smoothly, was no sign that he should be
trusted.</p>

<p>And so he continued to keep his gun raised,
seeing which the others did likewise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice, to hear you say such fine
things; but what we want to know is, what have
you done with our chum?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, tell us that!&rdquo; said George, menacingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, we want to know, by the same
token!&rdquo; observed the Irish lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;s aboard our boat, just now, and
will be glad to welcome you,&rdquo; the other party
remarked, coolly. &ldquo;And I hereby invite you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
one and all to come along to see for yourselves.
It&rsquo;s a mistake all around, I guess. Please
accept my invitation in the same friendly
spirit in which it is given, and honor us with
your company, boys. Josh is getting back to
his old self, but he had a nasty tumble, I give
you my word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He tripped over a root,&rdquo; said the man,
earnestly, &ldquo;and struck his head on a lump of
coquina rock. It made a bad cut on the side
of his head, and he bled quite a little. Besides,
the blow must have knocked him senseless.
My friend Carpenter and myself were
just coming back to the boat, after a little
side hunt for a deer, when we discovered him
lying there, and took him aboard. After he
came to, he told us who he was, and all about
the rest of you. And am I right in believing
that you are Jack Stormways?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course the three boys were more or less
thunderstruck by what they had just heard.
It knocked all their theories &ldquo;into flinders,&rdquo;
as Jimmy would have said. Here they had
been concocting all manner of wonderful
stories in connection with the two parties
aboard the little power boat. They had even
gone so far as to believe the men must be some
desperate characters, fleeing from the sheriff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
who might turn up at any hour in full pursuit.</p>

<p>And now, from what the other had just declared,
it would seem that the shoe was exactly
on the other foot. Instead of proving to be
lawless men, criminals in fact, they gave evidence
of turning out to be Good Samaritans.
Why, Josh might have been in a bad way, only
for them, according to what the man had just
said.</p>

<p>But could he be believed? Might it not all
be a part of some clever trap? George, always
inclined toward suspicion, would have held
back, had the decision been left to him; Jack
was inclined to take the man&rsquo;s word, for he
had a frank way about him; while Jimmy was
hanging in the balance, hardly knowing what
to believe.</p>

<p>Just then there came a shout from within
the cabin of the little boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Jack; it&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All of them readily recognized the well
known voice of Josh; and his assurance went
far toward alleviating the fear George entertained,
that danger lurked in their putting
themselves in the power of the unknown
parties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hear what your mate says, Jack?&rdquo;
remarked the man whose figure was outlined
against the glow of the cabin&rsquo;s interior. &ldquo;Tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
them to come aboard, and see what we did for
you, Josh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what, fellers. Nobody could
have been kinder. Don&rsquo;t stop there, but push
your way aboard. Cabin&rsquo;s small; but you can
all get your heads in,&rdquo; Josh went on to say.</p>

<p>Of course, after that even suspicious George
saw no reason for holding back longer. So
the three splashed along until they stood hip-deep
in the lagoon. The man even stretched
out a hand and assisted Jack aboard, as though
he bore them not the least bit of malice for
having held him up at the muzzle of their
guns.</p>

<p>As Jack clambered aboard, the first thing
he saw through the opening was Josh, with a
bandage around his head, which showed signs
of gore, telling that he must have received
something of a bad cut when he tripped and
fell.</p>

<p>Then all those signs around the spot, which
they supposed meant a struggle between the
boy and his two captors, had in reality been
made when the men attempted to lift Josh,
and carry his senseless form to their boat
near by.</p>

<p>Well, one thing was apparently explained.
There was no longer any mystery as to why
Josh had failed to respond when they shouted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and fired their guns. If at the time, he was
lying there senseless, he could not very well
be expected to give an answering halloo. But
then, why had not these two men done something
to let his companions know what had
befallen him?</p>

<p>That was what puzzled Jack. He should
have thought that the very first thing to occur
to them would be to send word to the camp
of the motor boat boys&mdash;unless, now, there was
some good reason for holding back until they
could question Josh, and make sure that he
did not have any connection with the sheriff
and his posse!</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is my friend, and cruising partner,
Mr. Bryce Carpenter,&rdquo; said the one who had
thus far been conducting the conversation
from their side. &ldquo;My own name is Sidney
Bliss. How about your friends, Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;George Rollins, the first one, and Jimmy
Brannigan the other,&rdquo; Jack immediately
spoke. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve left two more in camp, while
we hunted for our lost chum. Hello! Josh;
awful glad to find you alive and kicking; but
don&rsquo;t like the looks of that bloody pack around
your head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh! I guess I got a pretty hard knock
on my coco, all right,&rdquo; grinned Josh; and he
did look so comical, with that turban-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
bandage, and his face flecked with little specks
of dried blood, that Jimmy burst out into a
merry laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, ye did, Josh, ye spalpeen!&rdquo; he declared,
thrusting one arm into the cabin, so
as to clutch the hand of the discovered comrade;
&ldquo;but &rsquo;tis a tough nut ye&rsquo;re afther having,
I do declare, which is a fortunate thing
for ye this night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All that he told you is square as a die, fellers,&rdquo;
Josh went on. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;ve been
mighty kind to me, I give you my word. I
didn&rsquo;t know where I was when I came out of
the doze; but they asked me a lot of questions,
and in that way we got to be right well acquainted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! you see,&rdquo; the man who had called
himself Sidney Bliss hastened to say, &ldquo;we had
some good reasons for feeling suspicious
toward your party, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why,&rdquo; returned the boy, instantly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come all the way down the
coast from Philadelphia, and never once bothering
ourselves about anybody else&rsquo;s business.
George, here, got into rather a little fever because
he said you seemed to be watching us
through the glasses whenever we happened to
come near each other, but it was none of our
business, and I wouldn&rsquo;t let it bother me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>That was as plain an invitation for an explanation
as could be imagined; and apparently
so the other looked at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, after learning just who you were,
and that you couldn&rsquo;t have the least connection
with Lenox and his crowd, we had to laugh
at our suspicions,&rdquo; Bliss went on to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t happen to know anybody by the
name of Lenox, do we, boys?&rdquo; Jack took occasion
to remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nixy, not,&rdquo; Jimmy asserted, after his
usual manner, while George, too, shook his
head in the negative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only Lenox I ever knew was a sickly little
chap who went to the same boarding school I
did about six years ago,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Josh says you&rsquo;re all from out Mississippi
way,&rdquo; the man continued, glibly; &ldquo;and
this Lenox is a New Yorker. Besides, he&rsquo;s
a man of about forty, and not a boy at all.
Belongs to the same club Carpenter and myself
do; and thereby hangs the tale that sent
us away down here, and made us eye your
crowd with suspicion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Jack said, feeling that he was expected
to make some sort of remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They told me all about it, fellers,&rdquo; spoke
up Josh; &ldquo;and after you hear, I guess you&rsquo;ll
understand just why they&rsquo;ve been playing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
hold-off game they did. It&rsquo;s all as square as
you&rsquo;d want it, take my affidavy on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Josh,&rdquo; laughed Bliss, good-naturedly,
as he glanced quickly toward his
companion; and Jack plainly saw him wink
his eye suggestively. &ldquo;After what we did for
you, it&rsquo;s evident that you have perfect faith
in our record. But, as I was saying, Jack, at
the club one evening, we got to disputing, and
Lenox, who pretends to be something of a
dashing small boat sailor, dared Bryce and
myself to enter into a competition with himself
and some of his friends. That&rsquo;s what took
us down here right now, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of competition, sir?&rdquo; asked
George, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To prove which party might turn out to
be the better sailors, we agreed to make the
complete circuit of the coast of Florida in
boats no longer than twenty-three feet; and the
ones who reached Pensacola first were to be
declared winners. Neither of us were to accept
the least outside aid, on penalty of being
declared losers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It sounded very nice, and yet Jack could
not forget that suggestive look which had
passed between the men. And he wondered
if there might not be something back of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
story Bliss was telling, something perhaps
much nearer the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I see now what you
mean. You kept watching us, then, because
you suspected we might be your rivals in the
race?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Jack,&rdquo; the man immediately
burst out with, seemingly pleased; &ldquo;you see,
my boy, our friend Lenox is known to be rather
a tricky chap. Carpenter and myself came to
the conclusion that he might resort to some
scheme to hold us back, and somehow we got to
look at your three boats with suspicion. Of
course it was all a silly mistake, as we know
now. But we&rsquo;re glad to have been of some
assistance to your mate, Josh, knowing full
well that you&rsquo;d have done as well by us if the
occasion offered. And, by Jove! you boys beat
us all hollow, when it comes to bold cruising;
for Josh has been telling us something of what
you&rsquo;ve done. I take off my cap to you, Jack
Stormways, as a Corinthian sailor!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a><br />
<small>IN HONOR BOUND.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Thank you for the compliment,&rdquo; Jack
said; &ldquo;but there are just six of us, all told;
and each one is as much entitled to your praise
as I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I object,&rdquo; George broke in. &ldquo;Lots of
times the pack of us would have been in a bally
lot of hot water only for the clever way you
had of handling things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s no lie, either!&rdquo; burst out
Jimmy. &ldquo;Whin there&rsquo;s any credit flyin&rsquo;
around loose, sure Jack desarves the lion&rsquo;s
share, so he does now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better and better!&rdquo; cried the man who had
given his name as Bliss. &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re as
loyal a bunch of chums as I ever ran across.
It&rsquo;s a rare treat for my friend Carpenter here
and myself to meet up with such fellows, eh,
Bryce?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The way he laid particular emphasis on that
name every time he used it somehow gave Jack
the impression that he did not wish the other
to forget who he was! It was of course a queer
feeling to have, but the boy could not get it
out of his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How about going back with us, Josh; feel
equal to a little walk; or shall I come around
after you in a small boat?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rats! what d&rsquo;ye take me for?&rdquo; demanded
Josh, indignantly. &ldquo;Just because I&rsquo;ve got a
little puncture in my noggin is no sign I&rsquo;m out
of the running. Why, course I&rsquo;ll go back with
you, and right away, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the hurry, boys?&rdquo; asked Mr. Bliss,
quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, for one thing,&rdquo; Jack remarked,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got a couple of anxious chums in camp,
who&rsquo;ll be eating their heads off with curiosity
to know what&rsquo;s become of Josh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; declared the tall lad, chuckling;
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a shame to keep poor old Nick
away from his feed so long. Ten to one he&rsquo;s
as hungry as a bear right now, waiting for
grub time to come around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you stay and have a bite with
us?&rdquo; asked Mr. Carpenter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not extra
fine cooks, but we&rsquo;ve got lots of good stuff
aboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right kind of you,&rdquo; George thought
he ought to say; &ldquo;but, considering the circumstances,
I reckon we&rsquo;d better be going, if Josh
says he&rsquo;s fit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll show you I&rsquo;m feeling just like
myself, and not a bit weak, after bleeding like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a stuck pig,&rdquo; and the long-legged boy started
to climb out of the cabin as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please wait a minute,&rdquo; Mr. Bliss interrupted.
&ldquo;If you must go, there&rsquo;s no need of
Josh getting himself all wet. You see, we&rsquo;ve
got it fixed so we can push ashore by a very
little effort on our part, right alongside the
roots of that tree; and where the water chances
to be fairly deep. We had the boat in there
when we brought your friend along, and it&rsquo;ll
be easy to get back again. Then a jump lands
you, safe and sound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He snatched up a setting pole, the most useful
thing that can be carried on a cruise along
the shallow waters of the keys, and with very
little effort managed to send the anchored boat
into the tiny cove, his companion having loosened
the anchor cable meanwhile.</p>

<p>Jack was the first to spring ashore, and the
others followed quickly at his heels, with Josh
bringing up the rear, and anxious to prove
his words true about being in first rate condition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad to have made your acquaintance,
boys,&rdquo; said Mr. Bliss; &ldquo;and if we happen to
cross each others&rsquo; path again, there&rsquo;s no reason
why we shouldn&rsquo;t be friends, is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I should say our chum here is under
heavy obligations to you, sir; and on his account,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
if no other, we&rsquo;d feel inclined that way,&rdquo;
returned Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shake hands on that, Jack,&rdquo; Mr. Bliss remarked;
and each of the four boys in turn
did so, even carrying the friendly act out with
the other skipper of the little power boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best of luck go with you all!&rdquo; called
out Mr. Bliss, waving his hand after them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same to you, sir!&rdquo; replied George, who had
apparently quite gotten over the suspicions
by which he had been almost overpowered
earlier in the evening.</p>

<p>And presently, after they had pushed their
way across the tongue of land lying between
the two lagoons, they could only tell where
the boat which they had just left lay, by the
glowing light flooding out of her cabin.</p>

<p>Jack placed himself at one side of Josh,
while George lined up on the other. But the
lanky boy observed these movements with suspicion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s this mean?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;Got an idea I&rsquo;m apt to keel over any old
minute, have you? Just because I did that
silly thing once, now don&rsquo;t you think she&rsquo;s
goin&rsquo; to get to be a habit with me. That&rsquo;s a
mistake, fellers. I&rsquo;m tougher&rsquo;n you reckon on,
now. Come along, buck up, George, and hit up
a faster pace.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on, now,&rdquo; said George, as he struggled
with a vine that had caught him under
the chin, and almost lifted him off his feet;
&ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t any such hurry as all that, you
know. It&rsquo;s bad walking here, and I don&rsquo;t feel
like being strangled just yet awhile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, pull in your horses, Josh,&rdquo; Jack remarked.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll believe you&rsquo;re all right without
you being in such a rush about getting
back to camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three minutes later Jack spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of you noticed that either of those
gentlemen came ashore after we left, did you?&rdquo;
he asked, quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no, of course they didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; George
remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For what are you askin&rsquo; that same question?&rdquo;
demanded Jimmy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps I might give a guess,&rdquo; remarked
Josh, quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I only wanted to make sure that anything
we might say to each other wasn&rsquo;t likely
to get to their ears,&rdquo; Jack went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, now you&rsquo;ve gone and got me guessing
good and hard again,&rdquo; remonstrated George.
&ldquo;You seem to just love to say things that sound
so mysterious. Tell a fellow, Jack, there&rsquo;s a
good chap, why you don&rsquo;t want them to hear
us talking. Why, we hadn&rsquo;t ought to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
anything but good words to say about those
gentlemen after the fine way they acted toward
our chum here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough, George,&rdquo; Jack went
on to say; &ldquo;and make up your mind I&rsquo;m the
last one to look a gift horse in the mouth to
find out his age; but there were a few things
about our two new friends that somehow made
me sit up and take notice; and I wanted to
ask Josh here what he thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just expected you&rsquo;d be up to that dodge,&rdquo;
the party in question observed, with a little
chuckle, as of amusement. &ldquo;I knew that if
anybody could get on to their curves, Jack
would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curves!&rdquo; repeated George, wonderingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, he do be thinkin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s playing baseball
again,&rdquo; laughed Jimmy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And from the way you talk, Josh,&rdquo; Jack
went on, paying no attention to these side remarks
on the part of his other chums, &ldquo;I can
give a guess that you must have made some
little discovery on your own hook that has told
you our two friends might be playing a little
game of blindman&rsquo;s buff with us right now.
How is that, Josh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack, you&rsquo;re the greatest feller I ever
struck, to get on to anything,&rdquo; replied the
long-legged one, admiringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t answering my question,&rdquo; the
other continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll say, yes,&rdquo; Josh went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us what it was you heard,&rdquo; George
asked, once more fairly boiling with a desire
to know everything connected with the mysterious
passengers of the little power boat that
had acted so strangely on the trip down the
east coast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute,&rdquo; said Josh. &ldquo;This
bandage is slipping down, so I&rsquo;ll have to get
you to fix it for me, boys. Hope the hole&rsquo;s
leaked all it&rsquo;s going to, because I can&rsquo;t afford
to lose as much fluid as some fellers, Nick for
instance. There, that feels all right. Now,
what was you saying to me? Oh! yes, about
how I happened to get onto the fact that the
two gentlemen that took me aboard their boat
might be somethin&rsquo; else besides what they said.
Was that it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what it was!&rdquo; George came back,
knowing how Josh always liked to beat about
the bush more or less before telling anything
he knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s the way it stands, fellers,&rdquo;
went on Josh. &ldquo;You see, after they carried
me on board the boat, I laid there like a
mummy in a trance. But by slow degrees I
began to come back again. And all the while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
my eyes must have been shut, I could hear
some mumbling voices, though for the life of
me I couldn&rsquo;t make out who it was talkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! hurry up, old ice-wagon; get a move
on you, and tell us!&rdquo; exclaimed George, almost
biting his tongue with impatience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard one man that I afterwards knew
was Mr. Bliss say, as plain as anything: &lsquo;I
tell you, they&rsquo;re nothin&rsquo; but boys, and they
ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to give us away.&rsquo; And then the
other one, he says, says he: &lsquo;If I thought this
one knew anything, I&rsquo;d be tempted to let him
lie there where we picked him up, that&rsquo;s what.
We can&rsquo;t afford to take any chances, and you
know it, Sam!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack gave a low whistle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet Mr. Bliss said his friend&rsquo;s name
was Bryce Carpenter,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I had
an idea all along, from the way he called that
name, he wasn&rsquo;t used to saying it. Sam came
easier to his tongue. Now, we don&rsquo;t know who
Sam is, or what he&rsquo;s done, but seems to me
there&rsquo;s something crooked about that yarn they
set up, of a wager made with that Lenox
fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They never made such a wager,&rdquo; declared
Josh, stubbornly; &ldquo;and right now the only
thing they want to do is to get around to
Tampa, where they expect to slip aboard a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
boat bound for Cuba. I heard some more talk
before I opened my eyes and spoiled it all.
If the one who calls himself Carpenter hadn&rsquo;t
got cold feet, their plan was to drop down the
keys to Key West, and get across to Havana
from there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s that to us?&rdquo; remarked Jack.
&ldquo;They treated you white, Josh, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They sure did,&rdquo; answered the other,
warmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Jack went on; &ldquo;then it&rsquo;s no business
of ours who and what they are; and we&rsquo;ll
just have to forget them. But, listen, wasn&rsquo;t
that a shout ahead, there?&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a><br />
<small>AN INVASION OF THE CAMP.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I heard it, too, Jack!&rdquo; exclaimed George;
but neither of the others seemed to have noticed
anything, though in the case of Josh,
with his head tied up, this was really not to
be wondered at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of a sound was it, boys?&rdquo; demanded
the tall one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it was a shout of some kind; how
about it, George?&rdquo; Jack replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here. But then, perhaps it&rsquo;s only
Herb and Nick skylarking. Once in so often
Nick gets a streak, and thinks he has to work
off his high humor. But see here, Jack, I hope
you don&rsquo;t imagine some sort of trouble has
dropped in on the two boys we left in camp
less than an hour back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Jack made answer,
in a half-hesitating way. &ldquo;But somehow it
struck me that yell was more along the line of
anger or fright than the result of high spirits
or kidding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Jack, we don&rsquo;t hear any more of the
same sort?&rdquo; George remonstrated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that, then?&rdquo; asked the other, as a
plain whoop came faintly to their ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s Nick, all right,&rdquo; Josh declared,
stoutly. &ldquo;I could tell his shout among a thousand.
There never was one like it. I always
said a wild Injun from the Crow reservation
couldn&rsquo;t begin to hold a candle to Nick, when
it came to letting out a whoop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what would make him give tongue that
way?&rdquo; asked George, as he pushed on at the
heels of the leader; for they were now following
what seemed to be a trail through the
undergrowth, where the trees grew sparingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Troth, and I hope now, nothing has happened
to Herb,&rdquo; Jimmy remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! let up guessing that way. Whatever
could happen to either of them, tell me that?&rdquo;
George demanded. &ldquo;We left the boys safe in
camp; and they even said they believed they&rsquo;d
go aboard one of the boats, although making
sure to keep the fire going, so we would see
it, if we got mixed in our bearings, while skirting
the short line. Maybe you&rsquo;d expect an
alligator to crawl in from the swamp, and try
to make a meal off our chums?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; demanded Josh. &ldquo;I
reckon, now, they have just such reptiles in
this region, don&rsquo;t they, great big fellers, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
some call them crocodiles, I&rsquo;m told. But there,
Nick tunes up again, like a good feller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be something wrong, or he
wouldn&rsquo;t show so much excitement. Make all
the hurry you can, boys. We&rsquo;re getting closer
all the time; yes, and it seems to me I can
almost make out what he&rsquo;s shouting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Jack, for I&rsquo;d take my affidavy
I heard him say just then: &lsquo;Get out, you
robber! skedaddle, now!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds like some one had found the
camp, and was trying to steal our belongings!&rdquo;
George exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope they lave the boats, that&rsquo;s all;
for the walkin&rsquo; do be harrd, I&rsquo;m tould, between
here and Meyers,&rdquo; Jimmy up and said, in his
whimsical way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious! you don&rsquo;t think, now, that
anybody would be so mean as to try and crib
our bully boats?&rdquo; gasped George; and no matter
what oceans of trouble his <i>Wireless</i> may
have given him in the past, all was forgiven
now, when danger lurked over the motor boat
flotilla.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along!&rdquo; called Jack, over his shoulder;
&ldquo;the quickest way to find out what it all
means, is to get there. Hit it up a little
swifter, all of you! Put your best foot forward,
and run!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>They accordingly did so. What mattered
it if occasionally one of them did happen to
trip, and come down with a hard thump; it
was only a question of a few seconds for the
unlucky one to scramble to his feet, and a few
bruises more or less surely did not count.</p>

<p>In this fashion, then, they covered the remainder
of the ground that lay between the
camp and themselves.</p>

<p>Jack, being in the lead, was the first to
glimpse what was going on. He held up a
warning arm to head off the impetuous rush
of his mates; and as they could plainly see his
figure outlined against the bright background
of the fire-lighted zone, George and Josh and
Jimmy all drew up alongside the leader.</p>

<p>No one said anything. They were too busily
engaged taking it all in, to express themselves
in any way. And, indeed, it was a sight well
worth observing, one that would return to
them many a time, and always cause a smile
to creep across each boy&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>For it was more humorous than tragical,
though possibly one of the actors in the affair
looked upon it in the light of a serious proposition.</p>

<p>First, there was Herb aboard the good old
<i>Comfort</i>, and engaged in waving the ax, upon
which he seemed to lay considerable dependence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
He appeared to be defying some enemy,
and promising all sorts of dire things if so be
the boat was boarded.</p>

<p>But Nick&rsquo;s clarion voice was proceeding
from a higher place; in fact, it seemed to ooze
forth from the branches of a small tree that
happened to grow not far from where the
camp-fire had been started.</p>

<p>A look upward disclosed the fat boy, perched
among the branches of the said tree. He
varied his outcries by waving the shotgun,
which seemed to be utterly useless in so far as
discharging it was concerned.</p>

<p>There was a black bunch of hair busily engaged
in trying to tear open some of the provisions
that the fat boy had &ldquo;toted&rdquo; ashore,
in his desire to get supper started. It was, in
truth, a bear, a hungry animal that had declined
to gorge himself upon the remains of
the jewfish, when other and greater delicacies
were within reach.</p>

<p>It was breaking the heart of poor Nick to
see this vandal threatening to dispose of all
their precious food, so that they must go on
scant rations the rest of the way to Naples or
Meyers. No wonder that the hungry Nick
whooped and yelled, calling the black pirate
by all the hard names he could think up.</p>

<p>Now and then the animal would appear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
be disturbed by all this racket. On such occasions
he would shuffle over to the sapling in
which the fat boy was perched, raising his
snout to sniff the air, as though half tempted
to make the climb, and punish his detractor as
seemed most fitting.</p>

<p>Nick evidently became fearful each time
that he was going to be in for it. He would
howl worse than ever, and make all sorts of
dreadful threats as to what he might do in case
such a thing happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! ain&rsquo;t you the lucky thing, though?&rdquo;
he bellowed, just as the others ranged up to
take the whole picture in. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t been
silly enough to go ashore, carrying Herb&rsquo;s old
gun, and forget to put any shells in the same,
I guess you&rsquo;d be a dead bear right now, old
top! Here, quit shaking this tree, won&rsquo;t you?
Think you own the whole ranch? Reckon other
people got some right to live. Just go back
to your jewfish dinner, and all may be forgiven;
but you let our crackers and cheese and
bacon and hominy alone, hear that? Wow!
there, he&rsquo;s gone and busted the hominy sack!
Look at the gump wasting all that fine food,
would you? Herb, can&rsquo;t you <i>please</i> get some
of those bully old shells over to me somehow?
I&rsquo;d give a heap to tickle him between the sixth
and seventh ribs, sure I would!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then Jack gave a peculiar little whistle.
Nick heard it, and immediately &ldquo;perked up his
ears,&rdquo; as Josh called it. He could be seen to
twist his head around, and try to locate the
one who had given the well known signal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Jack! wherever are you?&rdquo; he called,
in perplexity.</p>

<p>Jack did not dare make any reply. He had
seen the bear start at the sound of the signal
whistle, just as if the sly beast understood that
it must surely spell danger for one of his type.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get ready to back me up, George, Jimmy!&rdquo;
Jack whispered.</p>

<p>They understood that since Jack carried the
repeating rifle, it ought to be his duty to fire
first. Should he make a failure, then they
could come in, to try and load the marauding
bear with all the lead possible. If, after all,
the beast managed to get away, he would at
least surely carry the marks of the warm
engagement with him the rest of his natural
life.</p>

<p>By this time both Herb and Nick had discovered
what was going on, and, naturally
enough, they were deeply interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give him Hail Columbia, Jack!&rdquo; called
Herb, waving his ax above his head, as he stood
there on the deck of the gallant old <i>Comfort</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
looking as though ready to hurl defiance at all
the bears in South Florida.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! be sure and pot him, Jack!&rdquo; cried
Nick, entreatingly. &ldquo;I always wanted to see
what real bear steak tasted like. And honest
now, I reckon it&rsquo;ll be sweeter because the old
villain ran me up this tree. Get a bead on him,
and make dead sure of your aim. Don&rsquo;t I
wish I had some buckshot shells up here?
Wouldn&rsquo;t I have enjoyed peppering him,
though. Wow! give him another for his
mother, Jack!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack had waited until the bear turned, so as
to expose his side. It was his desire to send
the bullet so that it would strike just back of
the foreleg, because he had always been told
that that was the most vulnerable spot in
which to hit any large animal.</p>

<p>When the opportunity came he sent in his
card. Instantly there arose a tremendous
commotion. The bear sent out a series of
roars and whirled around, to fall down, and
then struggle to its feet again, while Nick
shouted in his excitement, and the other fellows
added their voices to his chorus.</p>

<p>Jack coolly pumped another cartridge into
the firing chamber of his repeating rifle, and
stood ready to make a second try, if he found
reason to believe such action were needed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>It was quickly proven to his satisfaction that
nothing of the kind was required. The bear
soon toppled over again, and from the way in
which the poor animal kicked it was plain to
be seen that the last stage had come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bully! we&rsquo;re going to have bear steaks all
right!&rdquo; laughed the pleased Nick; and then he
added: &ldquo;Say, Jack, do you really believe the
old sinner&rsquo;s kicked the bucket, or is he playing
a little game to coax me down? I&rsquo;m sore from
hanging up here so long. Give him a punch
and see if he moves, George. My gracious!
what ails Josh, and where&rsquo;d he get that nightcap
he&rsquo;s wearing?&rdquo;&mdash;and, overcome by curiosity,
the fat boy came sliding down the bending
sapling, to land in a heap at its foot.</p>

<p>Herb too came ashore, filled with wonder,
and eager to hear the story, which was told as
they stood around the body of the bear that
had invaded the camp, and sent Nick in hot
haste &ldquo;shinning&rdquo; up a tree.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br />
<small>JIMMY REFUSES TO GIVE UP THE GAME.</small></h2>


<p>They were now fully in the great Gulf of
Mexico, and headed for Tampa. Nick had
been able to enjoy bear steak to his heart&rsquo;s content.
The others pronounced the meat pretty
dry, and poor eating; but when served in the
shape of a stew, or hash, it answered the purpose.
There was a whole lot, they decided, in
knowing that it <i>was</i> the genuine article.
Otherwise most of them would have declined
to eat it, just as they would tough beef.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack, is it true that there are ten thousand
of these mangrove islands?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got me there, Josh,&rdquo; laughed
the leader of the little expedition, as, several
days after the adventure with the bear, the
three motor boats glided in and out among the
queer collection of islets that marks the southwestern
coast of Florida.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re called on the map,&rdquo;
insisted Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! you don&rsquo;t suppose for a minute anybody
in the wide world could ever count these
mud flats, covered with the everlasting mangrove,
do you?&rdquo; Jack went on. &ldquo;A few hundred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
or even thousand more or less, wouldn&rsquo;t
matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; spoke up George, &ldquo;there
are just nine thousand, nine hundred and
ninety-nine too many. I could be satisfied with
one island. Why, for two days now, we&rsquo;ve
been going in and out of these bally old
bunches of mangroves, dodging storms, and
fighting skeeters to beat the band.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better be thankful,&rdquo; declared Herb,
&ldquo;that after you led us in a trap, Jack took us
out again, George. Only for him we might be
lost right now, miles deep in these everlasting
tangles. You notice that now we never get far
away from a sight of the big water, don&rsquo;t you?
It seems a dangerous business for a small boat
cruiser to wander into this nest down here.
He&rsquo;s apt to lose his head, and never come out
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do we pull up soon, Jack?&rdquo; asked Jimmy,
beseechingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, as the afternoon is going,&rdquo;
Jack replied; and then, as if noticing the
eagerness plainly marked upon his shipmate&rsquo;s
freckled face, he went on: &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s in the
wind with you, Jimmy? I can see that
you&rsquo;re thinking of some stunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jimmy laughed at that. The three boats
were moving slowly on, close together, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
could easily send a significant look toward the
complacent Nick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know what ails him, all right!&rdquo; cried
the fat boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then suppose you tell us, Nick?&rdquo; George
demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimmy&rsquo;s got an idea in his head that he&rsquo;s
going to knock my record for big fish all hollow,
and this place strikes him as likely to pan
out well. Haven&rsquo;t I seen him watching those
big tarpon jumping this very afternoon? I
just bet you he means to make a try for one
of them, as soon as we anchor for the night,&rdquo;
and Nick completed his assertion with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And have ye any objection to my makin&rsquo; a
thry, tell me that?&rdquo; Jimmy demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure not,&rdquo; Nick immediately replied;
&ldquo;only you&rsquo;re bound to have all the trouble for
your pains, Jimmy boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye think that way?&rdquo; asked the other, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for a lot of reasons!&rdquo; came from the
complacent Nick, ready to rest upon his honors.
&ldquo;First off, you&rsquo;d have to fish in one of
our little dinkies; and a tarpon is such a powerful
fish, it&rsquo;d drag you miles and miles
before giving up. Remember, you&rsquo;re not
allowed the least help to land the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Jimmy shook his head, and watched his
rival from under his heavy eyebrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Secondly,&rdquo; continued the fat boy, airily,
&ldquo;the biggest tarpon ever captured never
weighed as much as two hundred pounds,
remember that, Jimmy. Jack, would you mind
stating what we decided the weight of my jewfish
was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We agreed on two hundred and thirty as
about the right thing,&rdquo; came the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you are, Jimmy,&rdquo; mocked Nick.
&ldquo;Better forget all about tarpon, and turn your
attention to, say, whales.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, by the same token, they towld me
whales never come this far south, and so I&rsquo;ll
never get square with ye that way,&rdquo; grumbled
Jimmy. &ldquo;But never mind, me bhoy, sooner or
later you&rsquo;ll meet up with defate. I&rsquo;m still
studying the way I&rsquo;m bound to bring ye to a
Waterloo. The Brannigans never gave up,
rimimber. When ye laste expect it ye&rsquo;ll be
overwhelmed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not going to lose any sleep over
it. And while you&rsquo;re worrying that poor head
of yours, Jimmy, about the ways and means
of capturing a three hundred pounder, I&rsquo;m
just going to keep on feasting on these fine
oysters we&rsquo;ve been picking up right along.
Yum! yum! how I do love &rsquo;em, though!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we happen to know that,&rdquo; remarked
Josh. &ldquo;Fact is, we&rsquo;ve heard you make the
same remark ever since we set out from Philadelphia
on this cruise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if a fellow could see the piles of
oysters Nick&rsquo;s gobbled since that day, he&rsquo;d be
just staggered, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; George put in,
sarcastically; for, as the fat boy sailed in his
company, the skipper of the <i>Wireless</i> doubtless
grew very weary of hearing constant reminders
concerning feasts, past and to come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; sang out Jack just then, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see any reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t pull up here
as well as anywhere. Good anchorage, with a
chance for a breath of wind off the gulf tonight,
that may keep the savage little key
mosquitoes fairly quiet. What say, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they were all of a mind, the halt was
quickly brought about. They anchored in the
open; but in case of a sudden high wind arising
that threatened to make things unpleasant for
the small craft, it would be the easiest thing in
the world to push around in the lee of the
nearest mangrove island, which would serve as
a barrier against the storm.</p>

<p>Jimmy was soon seen paddling away in the
dinky belonging to the speed boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now what did he take your rifle for, Jack,
if he expects to go fishing?&rdquo; asked George,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
while Nick cocked up his ears, and listened as
though interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked him, and he only grinned at me,&rdquo;
Jack replied. &ldquo;But I made him promise not
to go beyond that big island you can see up
the channel a ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A short time later they heard a shot, followed
by several others, that made them sit
up and take notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, he got a crack at something!&rdquo; Nick
remarked, uneasily, for he remembered how
Jimmy had looked so queerly at him when departing,
as though he had something in his
mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll soon know; and I can see him
moving around in his boat up yonder right
now. Seems to me he&rsquo;s trying to get at something
in among the mangroves. He must have
made a kill of it,&rdquo; Herb declared.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later and Jimmy was seen approaching,
rowing steadily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at him, would you?&rdquo; called out the
anxious Nick; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s dragging something behind
the boat, as sure as anything!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack watched the performance for a minute
or so, and then remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks to me like a big &rsquo;gator; and that&rsquo;s
what it is, boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my!&rdquo; exclaimed Nick, bouncing up;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
&ldquo;I wonder now does the silly believe an alligator
would count against my fish? Jack, I
appeal to you to give him the law as she&rsquo;s
written in our compact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Jack refused to say anything prematurely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till he makes his claim,&rdquo; he replied,
with a laugh, as he watched the sturdy labors
of the Irish lad to rejoin them.</p>

<p>When Jimmy did arrive they saw that he
had indeed managed to shoot an unusually
large mossback &rsquo;gator, which he had possibly
discovered sunning itself among the mangroves.
As a rule the creatures prefer the
fresh water, but may on occasion be found
where there is a commingling of salt and fresh.</p>

<p>The exultant captor was grinning, as if
hugely pleased. He nodded his head in the
direction of the staring Nick, as he finally
came alongside. Then they saw that he had
been wise enough to take a rope along with
him, which had been hitched around the body
of the slain monster, just back of the short
forelegs. Nevertheless, it had taken considerable
of an effort to drag the saurian all the
way from the place of the tragedy to where
the three motor boats were anchored.</p>

<p>Jimmy wiped the perspiration from his red
face, as he exultantly cried out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;By the powers, can ye bate that, I&rsquo;d loike
to know, so I would? Two hundred and thirty,
did ye till me; sure this one must weight all of
twict that. I lave it to the umpire here to
decide, contint to rest on me laurels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick began to show signs of tremendous excitement
at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about that, Jack?&rdquo; he pleaded.
&ldquo;He went and shot it with the rifle, don&rsquo;t you
know? I don&rsquo;t call that fishing, now, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of people who shoot fish with
a rifle, lots of times,&rdquo; commented Herb, just
to excite Nick a little more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but don&rsquo;t tell me an alligator is a
fish!&rdquo; exclaimed Nick, in great disgust. &ldquo;Why,
when I was in the lower grade in school they
taught us to call it just a <i>rep-tile</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that a shout went up from the balance
of the voyagers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to settle this right on the spot,
Jack,&rdquo; declared George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out the articles of war and read what
it says; that&rsquo;s the only fair way,&rdquo; remarked
Herb.</p>

<p>So Jack deliberately took out his notebook,
and in a sing-song tone, assumed for the purpose,
read as he had done once before at
Jimmy&rsquo;s request:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Each contestant shall have the liberty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
fishing as often as he pleases, and the fish may
be taken in any sort of manner&mdash;the one stipulation
being that the capture shall be undertaken
by the contestant alone and unaided; and
that he must have possession of the fish long
enough to show the same, and have its weight
either estimated or proven.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here it is before ye, and riddy to be
weighed!&rdquo; said Jimmy, stoutly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Jack, what do you say, <i>is</i> an alligator
a fish in the true sense of the word?&rdquo; demanded
Nick, stubbornly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the umpire in this dispute,&rdquo; said Jack,
solemnly, &ldquo;I am forced to disallow the claim
Jimmy makes. No matter how he got his
prize, we can&rsquo;t swallow what he says about an
alligator being a fish, even if it does swim
under water; for it couldn&rsquo;t live there at all,
but has to come up on shore. So Jimmy, you&rsquo;ll
have to try again; and better luck to you next
time!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a><br />
<small>WHEN THE COMFORT WAS HUNG UP.</small></h2>


<p>Evidently Jimmy was not at all dismayed
by his present setback. As he said, he sprang
from stock that would never acknowledge
defeat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just wait, me laddybuck,&rdquo; he declared, as
he shook his finger at the grinning Nick; &ldquo;the
day is long yit, and by the powers, they be
other ways of beating that record ye&rsquo;ve hung
up. I&rsquo;ll kape me eyes about me, to say if
another jewfish wouldn&rsquo;t be afther stranding
himself for me &rsquo;special benefit. And who
knows but what this toime it may be a three
hundred pounder I&rsquo;ll be lugging into camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Jimmy,&rdquo; remarked
the fat boy, apparently not very much worried
over the possibility of losing his laurels;
&ldquo;but make sure of one thing before you claim
the earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what moight that be?&rdquo; demanded
Jimmy, innocently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t shout till you see whether it&rsquo;s
a fish&mdash;<i>or a log</i>!&rdquo; and Nick lay back on the
soft cushions he had brought on deck for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
own comfort, to laugh uproariously at his
remark.</p>

<p>Jimmy turned a bit red, but joined in the
general hilarity; for he was able to enjoy a
joke, even at his own expense.</p>

<p>Some days before, while Jimmy was fishing
very industriously, he had given a yell, and
was seen to be pulling at a tremendous rate at
something to which his hook had evidently
become attached.</p>

<p>Of course his rival had shown great interest
in his actions, for it looked as if the Irish lad
must have hooked a monster of a fish. But
when finally Jimmy was able, alone and unaided,
to bring the thing to the surface, he discovered,
much to his chagrin, that it was only
a sunken and waterlogged log. His own frantic
labor had given it all the wonderful movements
which he believed were the struggles of
a captured fish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I say, Jack, darlint,&rdquo; went on the
Irish boy, &ldquo;before I make another thry, plase
tell me this: Suppose now, ye should say me
comin&rsquo; back, and ridin&rsquo; on a manatee that they
do be havin&rsquo; around here&mdash;would ye call that a
fish, becase it lives, so they tell me, under the
wather all the toime?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He glared triumphantly at Nick, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
mouth opened in sheer amazement upon hearing
the audacious proposition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he don&rsquo;t take the cake for trying to do
the queerest things, now!&rdquo; the fat boy exclaimed.
&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s just silly to think of him
capturing a manatee, and harnessing it, like
they say Father Neptune does the dolphins.
And Jack, looky here, a manatee can&rsquo;t be a fish
at all, any more than an alligator is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me why?&rdquo; demanded Jimmy, pugnaciously.
&ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s amphibious it do be, and
lives under the water all the toime. I think
I&rsquo;ve got ye there, Nick, me bhoy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But listen,&rdquo; Nick continued, with conviction
in his manner, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you heard it
called a sea cow; and can a cow be a fish,
Jack?&rdquo; with which he turned triumphantly
toward the laughing umpire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what&rsquo;s the matter with a cow-whale?&rdquo;
asked Jimmy; &ldquo;and yet deny that a
whale is a fish if ye dare?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack, settle that, won&rsquo;t you, before he goes
and brings in every old varmint to be found in
this region?&rdquo; pleaded Nick.</p>

<p>But Jack was too wise. He did not want to
shut out the possibility of their having the
time of their lives, should the energetic and
ambitious Jimmy attempt to carry his plans
into effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not going to bother my head over
things that may never happen,&rdquo; he declared;
and with that Jimmy paddled away in the
little dinky, grinning broadly at the uneasy
Nick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody just knows what that fellow <i>will</i>
do next,&rdquo; muttered the fat boy, as he followed
his retreating rival with his eyes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jack was taking a look around
with his glasses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somehow I don&rsquo;t altogether like this place
after we&rsquo;ve anchored,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo; inquired Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For one thing,&rdquo; Jack continued, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
more exposed than would be pleasant, if one
of those Northers we&rsquo;ve been hearing so much
about should spring up in the night. And I&rsquo;ve
been watching those ibis and cranes flying
over for some time now. They all head in one
quarter, and from that I reckon there&rsquo;s a bird
roost over yonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herb pricked up his ears, for he had long
since expressed a desire to look in on a real
roosting place, where all kinds of birds came
together each night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Jack,&rdquo; he remarked, eagerly,
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s change our anchorage, and head that
way. It can&rsquo;t be more than a mile or so further
in, d&rsquo;ye think?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not more than that,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t want to get lost among these
blooming islands!&rdquo; said George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could make some sort of mark as we
go, to leave a trail, and it would be easy to
come out the same way,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s sensible
suggestion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how about Jimmy; if he came back
here, and found us gone, there would be a
howl, believe me?&rdquo; Nick observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It happens by good luck that he&rsquo;s headed
in just the right direction, so I could pick him
up on the way,&rdquo; Jack declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that would wind up his fishing for
today, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Nick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It surely would,&rdquo; was the reply of the
<i>Tramp&rsquo;s</i> skipper; whereupon the fat boy
heaved an audible sigh of gratification.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I vote in favor of doing what Jack
says, and having a peep in at the bird colony
tonight, if we can,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might as well, I suppose,&rdquo; Josh put in,
being somewhat curious himself with regard
to what such a roost looked like.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say this,&rdquo; continued Jack, who thought
his sudden desire to change their anchorage
needed further explanation, &ldquo;because I understand
that these roosts, once so plentiful in
Southern Florida, are hard to find nowadays;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and we might not have another chance to see
the sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happens to make &rsquo;em scarce?&rdquo; asked
Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well! the main thing has been that
plume hunters have found them out, and murdered
the birds by the thousands. It&rsquo;s worse
when they hunt out the nesting places of the
herons, and kill the mother birds, just to get
the aigrette, which, it happens, is always at
its best about the time the birds have young.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ve read a lot about that,&rdquo; mentioned
George; &ldquo;and they tell us that it&rsquo;s the most
dreadful thing to visit one of those nesting
places in the swamp after the plume hunters
have been at their bloody work. Thousands
of young birds are starving in the nests, and
the sounds they put up just haunt a fellow
forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of that in mine,&rdquo; declared tender-hearted
Nick, firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we all say the same,&rdquo; Jack added;
&ldquo;but when our intention is only to see what
such a place looks like, nobody can blame us
for going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hope not,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;But
do we get up our mudhooks right now, Jack,
and mosey out of this nook?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the programme, and here goes for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
my anchor. Whew! it&rsquo;s stuck fast in the mud,
all right. Give me a lift, Josh, after you and
Herb have pulled yours up on deck,&rdquo; and inside
of five minutes all of them had washed
the mud from the forked anchors, which were
then placed conveniently on the forward
deck, where they could be dropped overboard
with a push.</p>

<p>Then the boats moved off.</p>

<p>This time it was the steady going old <i>Comfort</i>
that took the lead&mdash;Jack being in no particular
hurry and George, as usual, being compelled
to tamper with his eccentric motor, before
he could get it to going right.</p>

<p>Of course Herb meant to fall back presently,
and let the <i>Tramp</i> take the lead; but it was
really so seldom that he had a chance to leave
the others in the lurch that he and Josh seemed
to enjoy running away.</p>

<p>Jack, of course, was on the lookout for the
first sign of his teammate. Jimmy was discovered
rowing frantically around one end of
the big island, as though, upon hearing the
popping of exhausts, he had been seized with
a sudden fear lest he was in danger of being
abandoned there in that terrible region, with
not a foot of high land within many miles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi! howld on there, Jack darlint!&rdquo; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
called out, stopping to wave a hand toward
the advancing <i>Tramp</i>.</p>

<p>When alongside he of course demanded to
know what it all meant; and upon learning
that they were about to go a mile or so further
in, Jimmy shook his head in a discouraged
manner, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrah! now, as if I couldn&rsquo;t say through
a stone that has a hole in the same. I do be
belaving that it&rsquo;s all the fault of that same
sly one, Nick. He&rsquo;s that fearful of me accomplishin&rsquo;
me threat, and securin&rsquo; a whopper of
a fish, that he invents all sorts of rasons for
being on the jump. But I&rsquo;ll get the better of
him yet, say if I don&rsquo;t, Jack, me bhoy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He climbed aboard, still grumbling, as
though unable to convince himself that this
was not all some smart scheme, engineered by
his rival, in order to keep him from securing
a prize catch.</p>

<p>Herb was still far ahead, and skirting some
of the many islands. When he reached a certain
point he had marked out for himself, he
intended to lie to, and wait for the coming of
Jack. George had started on at a fast gait,
and doubtless was determined to head off the
clumsy <i>Comfort</i>, which fact may have urged
Herb to do his best and cut corners sharply.
All of which led up to a sequel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack suddenly missed the loud noise that
usually accompanied the progress of the broad-beamed
boat. As he looked up he discovered
that George was heading straight for the <i>Comfort</i>,
which hung near the point of an island;
also that both Herb and Josh were jumping
wildly about, as though greatly excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do be the matter with the gossoons?&rdquo;
asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know for certain,&rdquo; replied Jack;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve got my suspicions. Herb was running
in a careless way and just as like as not
he managed to snag his boat. If that&rsquo;s what
happened, we&rsquo;re in for a peck of trouble; for
there&rsquo;s no boat builder within many miles of
this place, and we&rsquo;d be lucky to find even a
piece of shore to pull her up on.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a><br />
<small>THE BIRD ROOST.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s just like ye say, Jack!&rdquo; exclaimed
Jimmy, while they were hurrying
toward the imperiled boat at full speed.
&ldquo;They do be throwin&rsquo; wather out to beat bannigher.
Josh has got a bucket and Herb
handles a basin. Glory be! but this is a bad
job all around!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack was looking beyond the sinking boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can see a little bit of a shore just
over there,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;if only now we can
drag the <i>Comfort</i> there before she goes down.
You jump aboard with this bucket as soon as
we get there. She looks lower in the water
already, but one more hand to toss it out may
keep her afloat long enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jimmy was more than eager to lend all the
assistance in his power. No sooner had the
<i>Tramp</i> run alongside the other boat than he
was over the side. Nick, too, had been given
the same instructions by George, for he was
already laboring with might and main to reduce
the amount of water that persisted in
entering the big boat through the hole knocked
in her bottom by a stump or a submerged log.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, George, lay close alongside, and let&rsquo;s
get fast to her!&rdquo; Jack called out, realizing that
heroic measures were all that would save the
imperiled craft now.</p>

<p>Quickly they carried out the plan. Ropes
were passed back and forth, so that the <i>Comfort</i>
could not really sink, with two such
staunch boats buoying her up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued Jack, when this had been
accomplished, &ldquo;start your engine slowly and
we&rsquo;ll try and beach her over yonder. By the
greatest of good luck there&rsquo;s a small patch of
ground in sight, different from these mud
banks. Ready, George?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then go ahead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack held back until he heard the puttering
of the <i>Wireless</i> exhaust; then he also started
his engine, and the three boats moved slowly
and majestically off, the <i>Comfort</i> looking, as
Josh expressed it, like a wounded duck sustained
by the wings of two companions.</p>

<p>Those aboard the sinking craft had to keep
up their work in a frantic manner, if they did
not want the boat to go down under them in
midstream. Now and then one would make a
bad shot, and spill the contents of bucket or
basin over the forms of his fellow laborers.
But although this might have seemed comical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
to Nick or Josh or Jimmy at another time,
they failed to laugh now, even when struck
full in the face by a deluge, and half choked.</p>

<p>Fortunately the other island, where the little
patch of rising ground had been discovered by
Jack, was close at hand, so that in less than
ten minutes they had arrived as near as they
dared go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m going to break loose and get behind,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;If I can shove her further
in, it&rsquo;ll be all right, for then she won&rsquo;t
sink any lower. In the morning we can get the
block and tackle, and drag her out on skids.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The workers were encouraged to keep at it
furiously for another minute or two, while the
<i>Tramp</i> did the shoving part. Knowing just
how to go about it, Jack made a success of his
part of the business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; gasped Nick, when the keel
grated on the bottom, and the weary water-casters
could rest from their labors.</p>

<p>But there was a lot more to do. The bedding
and stores that were aboard had to be rescued,
and placed where they might have a
chance to dry. It took some little time to get
all the stuff out; and then Jack had another
idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I might shove her up still further,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
if you fellows went ashore,&rdquo; he suggested;
which they declared to be a good thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Jack, when he had actually
succeeded in pushing the stranded <i>Comfort</i> a
foot or so further in, &ldquo;what does it matter?
We&rsquo;ll have to make a couple of skids tomorrow,
and get a purchase on some of the mangroves
yonder; when we can yank her up, no
matter where she is. And now I vote that we
get ashore, and see about starting supper. I&rsquo;m
as hungry as a bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; applauded Nick. &ldquo;And
while I&rsquo;m about it, I guess I had ought to
change my shoes and socks, because I&rsquo;m wet to
the knees; fact is, I&rsquo;m pretty well soaked all
over. Josh kept emptying his old pail over
me right along. I guess I swallowed as much
of the salt stuff as he got over the side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, by the time night had set in, the
boys were all feeling in a better humor. Those
who were wet had changed some of their
things, and dried the rest beside the fire that
was burning cheerily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it, Jack?&rdquo; asked
Herbert, after the other had made as good
an examination of the hole in the bottom of the
wrecked motor boat as the circumstances permitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a clean hole, all right,&rdquo; was the response,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see any reason why we
can&rsquo;t patch it up to last until we get to a boat
builder&rsquo;s yard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right glad to hear you say that,&rdquo; continued
the anxious skipper, &ldquo;because, as you
all know, I&rsquo;m mighty fond of my boat, and
would hate like everything to have to abandon
the poor old thing in this place. So now I can
eat some supper with a touch of appetite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At any rate it was pleasant to again stretch
their legs, after being confined to the boats for
several days. And Josh seemed to have enjoyed
cooking a full meal once more for the
crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, how about that roost; do you suppose
we can find it from here?&rdquo; George asked, when
they were about through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you still feel like going, I think it won&rsquo;t
be a hard thing,&rdquo; Jack declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Count me out, please,&rdquo; Nick remarked. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe I care enough about it; and, besides,
somebody ought to stay here, to keep the
fire going, so you can tell where to come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh! he&rsquo;s clean filled up to the top, that&rsquo;s
what,&rdquo; remarked Josh; &ldquo;and when Nick gets
that way, you just can&rsquo;t coax him to budge an
inch. But I&rsquo;m with you, boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was presently decided that all the others
would go in the three tenders. As Nick was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
given a shotgun, this time fully loaded, and
ready for business, he expressed himself as
willing to stand guard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; he observed, with a wide smile,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t reckon on having any bear for a visitor
this time. He couldn&rsquo;t get on this island,
could he, Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in a thousand years,&rdquo; was the reassuring
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you can stay aboard the <i>Tramp</i> until
we come back,&rdquo; George went on to say. &ldquo;Only
don&rsquo;t let that fire go out a minute, or perhaps
you&rsquo;ll be minus all your chums. A nice time
you&rsquo;d have here, all alone, wouldn&rsquo;t you?
Why, you&rsquo;d starve to death before long with
that appetite of yours, Nick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shucks! there ain&rsquo;t much danger of your
getting lost while Jack&rsquo;s along. If it depended
on you, George, I&rsquo;d be scared right bad
now,&rdquo; the fat boy got back at him as the party
moved away.</p>

<p>They took the lighted lantern with them,
and expected to be very cautious how they
managed, not wanting to lose their bearings in
the darkness. Jack had made a mental map
of the vicinity, and behind that he could find
his way back to where the fire showed.</p>

<p>He led off, paddling with one of the oars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
for when the little dinky held two these could
not be used in the ordinary fashion.</p>

<p>And it was not very long before the others
knew that again Jack had shown more than
ordinary skill, for they reached an island
where, from the sounds, it was evident that the
roost of the birds could be found.</p>

<p>Landing, they made their way over the exposed
roots of mangroves and cypress trees,
gradually drawing near the middle of the
island. And here they found what they
sought.</p>

<p>Jack made several torches out of some wood
he found, and when these were lighted they
saw a sight that none of them would soon forget.
Thousands of birds were in the trees,
many of them herons, ibis, cranes and water
turkeys.</p>

<p>For some time the boys looked at the spectacle.
Then, tiring of it, as well as objecting
to the anything but pleasant odor of the roost,
which had long been in use they imagined, they
retreated again to the boats, after which the
return trip was begun.</p>

<p>Nick had kept the fire going, and little
trouble was experienced getting back to
where the larger craft awaited them.</p>

<p>The night passed quietly and with the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
they began to make preparations looking
to the repairing of the snagged <i>Comfort</i>.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, Jack set out with the ax,
and Josh to help him, taking two of the small
boats. When he found a couple of cypress
trees that he thought would answer the purpose,
over on Bird Island, as they had named
the place of the roost, he cut them down, and
by hard work they towed the intended skids to
camp.</p>

<p>Here they were shaped, and placed in position.
Then the block and tackle, which had
been carried on board the roomy <i>Comfort</i>,
were brought into play.</p>

<p>Jack selected the strongest mangrove within
line of the boat that was to be hauled out,
when fastening the tackle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you are, now, fellows!&rdquo; he declared,
when all was ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along, everybody, and take a grip
on the rope,&rdquo; invited Herb, who was more than
anxious to get busy at the job of patching the
smashed sheathing of his boat, so they could
continue their voyage.</p>

<p>Even Nick was made to lend the power of
his muscles to the good work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we could only get the full force of his
weight, she&rsquo;d come with a rush,&rdquo; Josh had declared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
though the fat boy only noticed the slur
with a smile and a nod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you all ready to pull?&rdquo; asked Jack,
who, being master of ceremonies, had the leading
position on the line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure we are; get busy, Jack, darlint!&rdquo;
sang out Jimmy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then altogether now, and away we go!&mdash;one,
two, three! She moved that time, fellows,
I tell you. Once more now, yo-heave-o! That
was worth talking about, and she jumped six
inches. Again, and put every ounce of muscle
into it! Now, then, up with her! Another
turn! That&rsquo;s the way to do it, boys!&rdquo; And
Jack continued to encourage his mates to do
their level best until they had dragged the
<i>Comfort</i> up the skids to a point where one
could crawl underneath her exposed keel.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a><br />
<small>A SCREECHER FROM THE NORTH.</small></h2>


<p>All of them awaited the verdict with bated
breath. Jack was down on his back under the
boat, and carefully examining the fracture
made by the snag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can mend it, all right,&rdquo; he announced,
as he finally snaked his way out.</p>

<p>A chorus of approval greeted the announcement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long will it take us, do you think?&rdquo;
asked Herb, who looked relieved to know that,
after all, his boat would not be lost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that depends. Perhaps by tonight it
may be in apple-pie shape, good enough to hold
out till we get to Tampa,&rdquo; Jack replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, looks like we might have the whole
bally armada in the hands of the ship joiners
at the same time,&rdquo; chuckled Nick. &ldquo;Because,
you know, George and me want to get a new
engine installed the worst kind, don&rsquo;t we,
George?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The skipper of the <i>Wireless</i> grunted in reply;
Nick was evidently running things now
with regard to that change in motive power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and did not mean to let his mate draw back
from his word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But first of all, we&rsquo;ve got to drag the boat
up further,&rdquo; continued Jack. &ldquo;You see, if
I&rsquo;ve got to work at that broken place for hours,
I&rsquo;m bound to have it more comfortable than
now. Lying on my back would knock me out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly they all took hold again, after
the tackle had been shifted. It was not so difficult
a thing to do, with six sturdy fellows to
pull a rope; and presently the <i>Comfort</i> was
elevated at a point that would allow one to
kneel under her keel.</p>

<p>Jack made his preparations, and set to work.
With the willing Herb to assist in any way
necessary, the others of course were not
needed.</p>

<p>Josh amused himself after his favorite manner,
studying up some new dishes with which
he figured surprising his chums some fine day.
George could always find plenty to do pottering
with his engine, and trying to cure its
faults; for hope dies hard in the young and
sanguine heart.</p>

<p>Jimmy and Nick took to fishing, because
that employment seemed to engross their
every waking thought. When Jimmy started
out, the fat boy grew uneasy; and before long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
he, too, paddled away in one of the small
tenders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be sure and don&rsquo;t go out of sight of the
smoke from the fire,&rdquo; Jack had cautioned them
both; and Josh agreed to make use of some
pine wood he had picked up, in order to create
a black smoke; for Florida pine is full of
the resinous sap that burns fiercely, and makes
a dense smudge.</p>

<p>Jimmy did not remain long in one place.
He seemed very restless, as though he wanted
to move about, in order to be on the lookout for
a chance to make a grand haul. Nick followed
from time to time, meaning to be an eyewitness
to any remarkable event that took place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hoping to get fast to one of them tarpon,
that&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; was the conviction of the
fat youth, who had discovered that the king
fish of the coast was in evidence in those warm
waters. &ldquo;I just wish he would right now,&rdquo; he
went on, chuckling; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a whole heap to
see Jimmy pulled around by one of them high
skippers of tarpon. It&rsquo;d curb that ambition
of his, some, I guess now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, singular to say, Nick&rsquo;s wish was fated
to be realized. Jimmy&rsquo;s mullet bait was
gorged by a tarpon about the middle of the
morning. At the time the Irish boy chanced
to be either half asleep or else thinking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
something else. At any rate, the first thing he
knew of the circumstance, and that he was fast
to a streak of polished silver, was when the rod
he was holding was almost jerked from his
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoa, there, ye omadhaun!&rdquo; shouted
Jimmy, immediately bracing his feet so that
he might not be pulled from the dinky outright.</p>

<p>Then something sprang from the water not
fifty feet away. It was a lordly tarpon, shaking
its head, as if hoping to get rid of the
barbed hook.</p>

<p>A shriek from Jimmy, echoed by one from
Nick, drew the attention of all the others.
Even Jack came crawling out from under the
motor boat to watch the sport.</p>

<p>It was certainly a great time Jimmy had.
That little dinky was dragged around at a furious
pace, now darting to the right, and presently
whirled about to head toward the left, as
some new whim seized upon the captive fish.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Jimmy seemed to be getting
dizzy from the rapid evolutions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never tire that monster out!&rdquo; cried
Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And perhaps it might carry him out to sea,
and lose him there!&rdquo; suggested the cautious
Josh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, even if he tired the fish out, it
wouldn&rsquo;t weigh more than a hundred pounds;
so I think he&rsquo;d better cut loose,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s
dictum.</p>

<p>Accordingly he made a megaphone out of his
hands, and shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better let him go free, Jimmy; he&rsquo;ll upset
you, and perhaps bite you after he gets you in
the water!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith, what shall I be afther doing, then?&rdquo;
came back faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut loose! you&rsquo;ve got a knife, haven&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; called George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll lose me line that way, and the
hook in the bargain!&rdquo; remonstrated the reluctant
Irish boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, better that than your life, or my
boat,&rdquo; George told him.</p>

<p>So poor Jimmy found himself compelled to
creep forward, when the chance offered, and
push the blade of the knife against the taut
line. Of course it parted instantly; and he
came near capsizing when the little dinky
sprang up again, freed from the drag of the
big fish.</p>

<p>The tarpon went speeding away toward the
gulf, leaping madly out of the water now and
then, as though still trying to shake that jewelry
from its jaw, or else making sport of disconsolate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Jimmy, who sat there casting yearning
looks after his escaped prize.</p>

<p>He always maintained that it was a two hundred-and-thirty-five-pound
fish, though just
why he hit upon that odd figure Nick alone
could guess. The jewfish he remembered had
been calculated to tip the scales at two hundred
and thirty pounds. And it is always the
largest fish that gets away.</p>

<p>Well, after that disappointment Jimmy
might have been pardoned had he given up
for the day; but that was not his way. He kept
at it all the blessed afternoon. Several bites
rewarded his diligence, but he did not succeed
in getting fast to another of the silver kings.</p>

<p>And, greatly to his disappointment, the evening
came on with the grinning Nick still holding
high record in the contest.</p>

<p>Jack had been quite as successful as he had
ventured to hope. George and Herb both declared
that he had patched the fracture in the
ribs and planks of the <i>Comfort</i> in a truly shipshape
manner; and that there could be no question
about the repair holding, up to the time
they expected reaching Tampa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we go on tomorrow, do we?&rdquo; asked
Nick, anxious to get Jimmy away from the tarpon
temptation; for he feared the lucky Irish
lad might sooner or later get hold of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
monster, which would put his prize out of the
running.</p>

<p>Jack said there was nothing to hinder; and
with all of them, save perhaps Jimmy, feeling
quite happy and contented, the night came on.</p>

<p>In the morning they were off again, and that
day they saw the last of that weird region
charted as the Ten Thousand Islands. None
of them were sorry; indeed, the very monotony
of those mangrove covered mud flats had begun
to pall upon every member of the expedition.</p>

<p>When they began to see plumed palmetto
trees along the shore, the sight brought forth
cheers from several of the more joyous among
the voyagers.</p>

<p>And it certainly looked more like life to
note the buzzards floating overhead again, with
pelicans skimming the waves out on the gulf,
in search of their fish dinner. There were also
many water turkeys, with their snake-like
necks, and black cormorants swimming in the
lagoons behind the keys.</p>

<p>Jack, who had read up on the subject, related
how the Chinese fishermen make use of
such birds as these latter, trained for the purpose,
to do their fishing for them: a band being
fastened around each creature&rsquo;s neck, so that
it can never swallow its capture, which is, of
course taken possession of by the master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to make sure to get a good anchorage
tonight,&rdquo; Jack remarked to Herb; for the
two boats were moving along close together,
late that afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why so particular tonight; is it going to
be any different from others?&rdquo; asked the skipper
of the <i>Comfort</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t just like the looks of that sky
over yonder&rdquo;&mdash;and Jack pointed to the southwest
as he spoke. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been told that in
nearly every case these Northers swoop down
after the clouds roll up there, the wind
changing to nor&rsquo;west, and the cold increasing.
There&rsquo;s something in the air that makes me
think we&rsquo;re due right now for our first
Norther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But to Northern fellows that oughtn&rsquo;t
strike a wave of dread,&rdquo; declared Herb.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re used to winter ice and snow. The
thermometer down below zero never bothered
me. Why should it down here, when it don&rsquo;t
even touch freezing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait and see,&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;After
it comes, we&rsquo;ll know more than we do now.
But a harbor we must have. Keep your eye
peeled for what looks like a good landing
place, Herb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They found this presently, though the key
was not so heavily wooded as Jack had hoped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
to find; and he did not think it would wholly
break the force of the wind, should a gale
come roaring down upon them during the
night.</p>

<p>When they crawled under their blankets
about ten, the sky was clouded over, but nothing
else had come to pass. This condition of
affairs puzzled Jack, who did not know what
to think of it.</p>

<p>But when he was awakened later on by a
dull roaring sound, not unlike the noise of a
heavy freight train passing over a long trestle,
he sprang up, understanding full well what it
meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wake up, everybody; here comes your
first Norther!&rdquo; he shouted at the top of his
young and healthy voice.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a><br />
<small>THE SHELTER BACK OF THE KEY.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Oh! what happened?&rdquo; Nick was heard to
call out, in a tremulous voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get up and hustle! Show a leg here, or
you&rsquo;ll be frozen in your blanket!&rdquo; George
shouted, excitedly, for his canvas tent was wabbling
in the wind like a thing possessed.</p>

<p>Of course, those in the other boats had little
need to worry, since their hunting cabins protected
them in a great measure from the violence
of the gale. The neglect of George to
have the same sort of contrivance placed on
the <i>Wireless</i>, for fear lest it might reduce the
great speed of the boat, always cost him dear
when night came, or a storm howled about
their ears. One has to pay in some way or
other for his whistle; and George was a &ldquo;speed
crank&rdquo; without any doubt.</p>

<p>For a short time it was feared that the tent
on the <i>Wireless</i> would actually blow away.
Half dressed, the pair aboard hung on with
might and main to save the canvas, Nick&rsquo;s teeth
chattering tremendously as he shivered in the
rapidly falling temperature.</p>

<p>It certainly did get cold in a hurry, too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Jack would never more smile when he heard
old &ldquo;crackers&rdquo; tell about the terrors of a
Norther. Why, in spite of the protection of
the cabin walls, the bitter wind seemed to penetrate
to their very marrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Jimmy, this is mighty tough on
George and Nick,&rdquo; he remarked to his boatmate,
when the wind had passed its worst
stage, but the cold seemed to be on the increase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It do be the same; and &rsquo;tis myself that
feels bad for thim this blissed minute,&rdquo; the
warm-hearted Irish lad answered, as he
swung his arms back and forth to induce circulation,
and bring a bit more comfort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as I feared, the growth ashore is too
thin to fend off all the wind; and if this keeps
up we&rsquo;ll have the meanest night we ever
struck,&rdquo; Jack continued.</p>

<p>Jimmy knew from the signs that the skipper
had an idea. He was used to reading Jack
by now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can we be afther doing, I dunno,
Jack darlint?&rdquo; he remarked, or rather
shouted; for it was simply impossible to hold
a conversation in ordinary tones as long as
that howling wind kept shrieking through the
mangroves and cypress trees near by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get ashore, and throw up some sort of protection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
behind which we can make our fire,&rdquo;
Jack answered, readily enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurroo! that&rsquo;s the ticket! Let&rsquo;s be afther
getting to worrk right away. Sure, annything
is betther than howldin&rsquo; the fort aboard, and
shakin&rsquo; enough to loosen ivery timber in the
hull of the dandy little <i>Tramp</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jimmy was always enthusiastic about
everything he went about doing. Consequently,
he started ashore immediately, with
Jack trailing behind.</p>

<p>When George realized what his chums were
doing, he made haste to join them, for he could
not but understand that it was mostly on account
of the unfortunates aboard the exposed
<i>Wireless</i> that the effort to build a fire was
attempted.</p>

<p>Many hands make light work; and as there
happened to be plenty of wood available near
by, a fire was soon blazing. Then Nick, unable
to hold aloof any longer, came waddling
ashore, to offer his services, when nearly everything
had been completed.</p>

<p>Jack had found a means of building a wind
shield out of various things, and in the shelter
of this they hovered, keeping the fire going at
top-notch speed.</p>

<p>That night seemed endless to several in the
party. They huddled around, swathed in blankets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
like Esquimaux, and trying to sleep,
though Nick was about the only fellow who
managed to accomplish much in that line.</p>

<p>Fortunately it did not rain, which was
rather an unusual thing, since these cold storms
generally start out with a downpour, until the
wind shifts into the northwest, when it clears,
and turns bitterly severe.</p>

<p>But morning came at last, when they could
see to improve the situation. After Josh had
cooked the breakfast&mdash;and he had plenty of
help on this occasion, since every one wanted
to cling to the fire as close as possible&mdash;all felt
better able to meet the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing like a full stomach to make things
look brighter,&rdquo; commented Nick, sighing, as
he scraped the frying pan for the last remnant
of fried hominy.</p>

<p>The wind kept up all that day, so that the
pilgrims found themselves actually stormbound.
Jack would have made a try for
another harbor of refuge, only it was so very
rough between their key and the main shore
that he doubted the ability of the speed-boat
to make the passage without a spill; and surely
a bird in the hand was better than two in the
bush. They could not be sure about improving
on their quarters by going further.</p>

<p>Another thing influenced him to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
where they were. Gradually but surely the
wind was going down. The cold remained, but
with a dying breeze it did not penetrate so
much. It was decided that all of them but the
crew of the <i>Wireless</i> should sleep aboard their
boats on this night. George and Nick were
made fairly comfortable by the fire back of
the wind shield.</p>

<p>And as Jack had expected, during the night
there came another shift of the wind. Following
the natural course of the compass, it
was in the northeast when dawn arrived, and
would soon work around to the east. For,
strange to say, down in this country, during
the winter season at least, the southeast wind
is the very finest that blows; whereas in most
other places it has a reputation for being just
the meanest known.</p>

<p>All of them were so dead for sleep that the
next night passed very quickly. And when
morning came the change in the temperature
pleased them greatly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get a move on, fellows,&rdquo; Jack said,
after the customary attention had been given
to taking care of the inner man. &ldquo;We ought
to make a big dent in the distance separating
us from Meyers today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And by the same token,&rdquo; piped up Jimmy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
eagerly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afther hearin&rsquo; that the fishing is
mighty foine around this section.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted Nick, scornfully; &ldquo;when
you beat that record I&rsquo;ve hung up, just wake
me, and let me know. Time enough then to
get a hustle on. Just now it&rsquo;s up to you,
Jimmy, to do all the worrying. I&rsquo;m going to
take things easy after this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, me bhoy, just do that same, and
by the pipers it&rsquo;s ye that will be hearin&rsquo; a
cowld, dull thud, which will be that record
droppin&rsquo; to the earth. Sure, it do be a long
lane that has no turnin&rsquo;; and sooner or later,
belave me, &rsquo;twill be me day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They made a brave start. George was quite
elated with the splendid way his engine
worked, and frowned whenever Nick made out
to mention that his word had been pledged
about that change of motive power at Tampa.</p>

<p>Two hours later the inevitable came to pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George has hauled up short, Jack!&rdquo; Herb
called out; for the <i>Comfort</i> was not a great
distance behind the <i>Tramp</i> at the time, with
the other boat, as usual, ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps waiting for us?&rdquo; suggested Jack;
but the smile on his face declared that he entertained
different ideas about the stoppage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; replied Herb, skeptically;
&ldquo;but the chances are he&rsquo;s bucking up against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
trouble again. Won&rsquo;t we all be pleased as
Punch when he does get a motor that can motor
without eternally breaking down? There,
Nick&rsquo;s waving his red bandana, which I take
it means they&rsquo;ve broken down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so it proved. A weak place had developed
as usual, so that George would be compelled
to spend an hour or two mending the
same.</p>

<p>Herb generously offered to give him a tow;
but this the proud spirit of George would not
brook. It was bad enough having to suffer
that ignominy when threatened with a storm,
but when the gulf was smooth nothing could
induce him to accept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fellows go right along,&rdquo; George
called out; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll overtake you later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But neither Jack nor Herb would think of
such a thing. If a heavy wind chanced to come
up while the <i>Wireless</i> lay there, positively
helpless, she would roll frightfully, and stand
a chance of capsizing.</p>

<p>And so they simply hung around until the
makeshift repairs had been completed, so that
the speed boat could again proceed under her
own power.</p>

<p>This lost them so much time that it was no
longer possible to think of reaching the mouth
of the Caloosahatchee River, and ascending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
as far as Meyers, that day. So they kept an
eye out for a snug harbor, where they might
pass the night.</p>

<p>The coast was not so desolate here as below.
They had passed the settlement of Naples; and
here and there could see where shacks, or
more pretentious buildings, told of the presence
of fruit or truck growers.</p>

<p>Finally, toward the middle of the afternoon,
coming upon just the place that would afford
them a good camping ground, the three boats
pulled in.</p>

<p>Jack had noticed that Jimmy was showing
signs of growing excitement as they proceeded
to anchor. The Irish boy had been using the
marine glasses with more or less eagerness;
and no sooner was the boat made secure than
he broke out with:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, if ye plase, Jack darlint, but
I&rsquo;ve a most pressin&rsquo; engagement this minute.
I do be sayin&rsquo; me chanct to get aven with me
rival.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was even at the time throwing a number
of things into the little dinky, among others
a section of rope. Nick, while not overhearing
what was said, must have noticed the active
preparations for a sudden campaign. His
round, red face appeared over the side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
<i>Wireless</i>, as Jimmy pushed off and rowed
furiously away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what in the dickens does all that
mean, Jack?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Is Jimmy going to
make the trip to Meyers in that dinky, or has
he got an idea in his head he can bag something
that will make me look like thirty
cents?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather guess that&rsquo;s just the sort of bee
he&rsquo;s got in his bonnet, Nick,&rdquo; laughed Jack,
&ldquo;and if you look out yonder, where that reef
lies in shallow water, with the little waves
breaking over it, you&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s started him
going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick hunted around until he found George&rsquo;s
glasses, which he clapped to his eyes, to burst
out with a cry of astonishment and chagrin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, it must be a big porpoise that&rsquo;s got
stranded out there! My eye! look at it kick
up the water, would you? Oh! if Jimmy ever
gets a rope around that thing, and tries to
ride it ashore, won&rsquo;t he be in a peck of trouble,
though? But when Jimmy sets out to do anything,
you just can&rsquo;t frighten him off; and,
honest now, I believe he&rsquo;s bent on doing that
same mad caper!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a><br />
<small>JIMMY FORGES TO THE FRONT.</small></h2>


<p>None of them could have any doubt about
it; for was not the excited Jimmy making
toward that same reef with all speed? Determined
to wrest the laurels from his rival, if
it could possibly be done, he had only too
eagerly seized upon this fine chance to get in
some strenuous work.</p>

<p>Looking beyond, they could see that the
stranded porpoise, if the object out yonder
really proved to be such a creature, still
threshed the water and strove to break away
from its place of captivity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ails the bally thing?&rdquo; grumbled the
anxious Nick. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t it back off, the
same way it came on? That&rsquo;s the only way
it could get into deep water. Did you ever see
such a looney, trying to keep on shoving
ahead, when all the while it gets in more shallow
water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh! seems to me there are others!&rdquo;
chuckled Josh; &ldquo;jewfish, for instance, don&rsquo;t
seem to have one bit more sense. Sometimes
they get left on a shallow place, and kick like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
fun, while waiting for the tide to rise and
help &rsquo;em off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! let up on that, Josh; &rsquo;taint fair to take
his side all the time,&rdquo; complained the fat boy,
straining his eyes to follow the movement of
his rival, now more than half way out to the
reef.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we always stand up for the under
dog; and just now Jimmy&rsquo;s in that position,&rdquo;
continued Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; spoke up George, encouragingly,
&ldquo;and when you get there, Nick, as you may
sooner or later, you&rsquo;ll see how gladly we&rsquo;ll all
give you our sympathy, eh, boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick refused to be comforted by the prospect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! Jack,&rdquo; he said, turning to the skipper
of the <i>Tramp</i>, who seemed to be bending
over his motor, as if about to turn his engine;
for a sudden idea had come into his head, &ldquo;is
a porpoise a <i>real</i> fish, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever makes you ask that?&rdquo; demanded
Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I want to know, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; replied
Nick, coolly. &ldquo;That Jimmy tries to just throw
his old net over anything that creeps, swims
or walks, and call it a fish. He tried it on us
with his blessed old alligator, you remember,
fellers; then, when we wouldn&rsquo;t stand for that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t you know how he tried to hook up one
of the sea cows they call a manatee, and make
us take that? Now he&rsquo;s after a porpoise; and
if he keeps on he&rsquo;d grab a hippopotamus, and
try to bluff us at that. Anything that goes in
water answers for Jimmy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if he gets a porpoise, he&rsquo;s got a fish
without any reason to kick over the traces,
Nick, and don&rsquo;t you forget that,&rdquo; George
declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, where you going, Jack?&rdquo; demanded
Nick, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought I&rsquo;d better take a little spin
out there, to keep an eye on Jimmy,&rdquo; replied
the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for? You don&rsquo;t think of lending
him a hand, I hope? Remember, the rules
of the game knocks all that sort of thing on
the head,&rdquo; Nick protested, vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No danger of my forgetting,&rdquo; laughed
Jack. &ldquo;But I happened to think how bold
Jimmy can be, and wondered if he mightn&rsquo;t
get in trouble somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Jack,&rdquo; spoke up George,
himself a very rash fellow on occasion; &ldquo;it&rsquo;d
be just like him to hitch on to that porpoise,
and help work him loose. Then we&rsquo;d see our
poor chum going out to sea like a railroad limited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
express. And Jack, if you&rsquo;ll allow me,
I guess I&rsquo;ll drop in, and keep you company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; declared Herb, crawling
aboard, as he pulled the <i>Tramp</i> close to the
starboard quarter of the <i>Comfort</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! wait for me, can&rsquo;t you!&rdquo; exclaimed
Nick, all excitement now. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s got as much
interest in this business as me, tell me that?
I ought to be along to judge if he takes his
fish in fair play, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fair play!&rdquo; jeered Josh, as he too slid
into the other boat after Nick; &ldquo;well, I like
that, now, after the way you lugged that poor
old weakened jewfish to camp. Any way
Jimmy can grab his game will count; and you
might as well make up your mind to it first
as last, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t you get to bothering your head
about me, Josh Purdue,&rdquo; Nick went on to say,
stoutly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a true sport, and can take my
medicine when I have to, as good as the next
one. And I guess I don&rsquo;t give up easy, do I?
But it ain&rsquo;t time for the shoutin&rsquo; yet. Jimmy
hasn&rsquo;t got his porpoise; and it mebbe don&rsquo;t
weigh more&rsquo;n two hundred and thirty pounds,
either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving the other two boats anchored in
quiet water, Jack headed the <i>Tramp</i> for the
reef, where the water was breaking softly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
over the submerged rocks; with the unfortunate
porpoise floundering in a helpless manner,
for the tide was almost at its lowest level.</p>

<p>Jimmy had by now arrived on the spot. He
must have arranged his plan of campaign as
he was rowing frantically out, for he lost no
time in getting down to business.</p>

<p>Those who looked saw him push his way up
to the reef after his usual bold fashion. If
some water came aboard the little dinky,
Jimmy gave the circumstance no heed. All he
could see was that struggling monster of the
deep, and the happy opportunity that had been
thrown in his way whereby he might cut his
rival out of the lead he had held so long.</p>

<p>For that joyous conclusion Jimmy was
ready to take all sorts of chances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at him, getting right up alongside
the kicker!&rdquo; exclaimed Nick, with an expression
of amazement on his rosy face; for he
could not help admiring the nerve exhibited
by his rival, even though deep down in his
heart he hoped the other might fail to land
the prize.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure he is!&rdquo; laughed Josh. &ldquo;Why, just
keep your eye peeled, Nick, old boy, and my
word for it, you&rsquo;ll see our little chum climb
right on the back of that bucking broncho of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the gulf, put a bridle in his mouth, and ride
him home!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! rats! you can&rsquo;t get me to believe that!&rdquo;
Nick flashed back; and yet, despite his brave
words, he watched the actions of the Irish lad
with deep anxiety, as if believing that no one
could tell what wonderful things Jimmy might
not attempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look there, would you!&rdquo; he exclaimed, a
few seconds later; &ldquo;what under the sun has
Jimmy got now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems to me like it&rsquo;s our ax!&rdquo; declared
George, with a harsh laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ax!&rdquo; snorted the indignant Nick; &ldquo;d&rsquo;ye
mean to tell me he expects to knock that poor
porpoise on the head, just like they do steers
at the stockyards; and then claim he <i>caught</i>
him? Well, I like that, now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in the game, Nick,&rdquo; declared Herb,
consolingly. &ldquo;Remember, you didn&rsquo;t use a
fish hook and line to bag your big jewfish; just
slung a rope around his gills, and walked away
with him through the shallow water near the
shore. I reckon even an ax might count, so
long as he keeps the fish, and brings him in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sho!&rdquo; Nick went on, as though disgusted;
&ldquo;but just think of getting a fish with such a
tool, as if you were just chopping a tree!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch him, now, if you want to see how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Jimmy goes at it; perhaps you may be only
too glad to do the same thing later on, when
you want to climb up and throw him off the
first rung of the ladder,&rdquo; Herb remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said wise Josh, &ldquo;it makes all the
difference in the world what position you hold
when condemning practices. What looks bad
to you, seems fair and square to Jimmy right
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! what a crack that was!&rdquo; George
exclaimed, as Jimmy brought down the ax on
the struggling fish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he hasn&rsquo;t got him yet, anyway,&rdquo; muttered
Nick, as they saw the water whipped
into foam around the little, wabbling dinky
boat occupied by Jimmy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He nearly took a header that time, let me
tell you!&rdquo; cried Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he sticks to his job, all right!&rdquo; laughed
Jack. &ldquo;See, he&rsquo;s aiming to get in another
crack, and there it goes. Whew! that was a
stunner, though!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A regular sockdolager!&rdquo; avowed Josh, who
was apparently enjoying the circus first-rate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it looks like it knocked the poor old
porpoise out of the running,&rdquo; commented
Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it did!&rdquo; George declared;
&ldquo;and there&rsquo;s Jimmy trying to get a hitch with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
his rope around the thing&rsquo;s tail. He&rsquo;s gone
and done it, as sure as you live! See him stop
to wave his hand at us; and he&rsquo;s got the widest
grin on his face you ever saw. Victory comes
sweet after having it rubbed in so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh! how d&rsquo;ye know the bally old porpoise
is goin&rsquo; to stand for more than my jewfish?&rdquo;
Nick grumbled; though his face began to wear
a look that comes with chagrin and defeat;
&ldquo;and even if it does, that don&rsquo;t wind things
up. Ain&rsquo;t I got just as much chance to bag
something bigger before we haul up at New
Orleans, tell me that, Josh Purdue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Course you have, Nick, old top,&rdquo; declared
Josh, who hoped to see the rivalry kept up to
the very last, since it was affording them all
so much fun; &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll back you for the boy
who can do big stunts, once you wake up to
it; eh, fellers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jimmy was now starting to row back toward
where the two other motor boats were at
anchor. He made but slow progress of it,
towing that now quiet captured porpoise; but
the rules of the game prevented the others
from giving him any sort of a lift.</p>

<p>Now and then the porpoise would get
stranded in the shallow water, and at such
times Jimmy was put to his wits&rsquo; ends to manage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
But by slow degrees he succeeded in
accomplishing the object he had in view.</p>

<p>Of course the others did not wait for him,
but ran back to where the camp was to be made
for the night. Josh was anxious to get ashore,
and start a fire; for all of them confessed to
being hungry. Nick only made one more remark
on the way back, and that gave them
an inkling of his ruling passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Jack, do you know whether a porpoise
is good to eat?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Jack replied that he had never heard of any
one eating one, though perhaps the meat might
appeal to certain appetites, like those of
Esquimaux, or the Indians of Alaska.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll bother about it, however,&rdquo;
Josh remarked, &ldquo;because we&rsquo;ve got
plenty besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Supper was well on the way when finally
Jimmy landed, his beaming face wet with honest
perspiration, and filled with the pride that
followed his recent exploit.</p>

<p>They all came down to view his capture, and
estimate the weight of the porpoise. The
opinion seemed to be that, while a small one,
it must weigh something close on to two hundred
and fifty pounds; but Nick declared he
would have to demand the proof before
giving in.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a><br />
<small>FROM TAMPA, NORTH.</small></h2>


<p>Everybody was merry that night at supper
but Nick. He tried not to show that he felt
his sudden and unexpected drop from the top
of the ladder to the lower rung; but it was
hard work. His laughter was only a hollow
mockery, so Josh declared; for the lean boy
certainly did like to rub it into his fat chum
when he had a chance.</p>

<p>Jimmy did not sleep well that night, though
everything combined to make it a pleasant
occasion for most of the others. Half a dozen
times he would creep out of his blankets to
see if the porpoise was still where he had tied
it, and lying in shallow water. Evidently he
feared lest some adventurous and hungry
shark come nosing around, and attempt to run
away with his prize, before its weight had been
positively settled.</p>

<p>Once Jack heard him poking vigorously in
the water with a pole, and muttering to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want to take a lunch off me porpoise, is
it ye&rsquo;d be afther doin&rsquo;, ye sly ould thafe of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the worrld?&rdquo; Jimmy was saying, as he
punched vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Jack, looking over the
side of the <i>Tramp</i>; as he happened to be up
just then, to find out what his shipmate meant
by getting out long before the first streak of
daylight was due.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s the bally ould crabs; they do be
tryin&rsquo; to nibble at me fish; and it kapes me
busy shooing the same away,&rdquo; Jimmy answered
back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the use bothering, since we
don&rsquo;t expect to eat the thing?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jimmy, quickly; &ldquo;but they say
ivery little bit helps; and wouldn&rsquo;t I be the
sad gossoon, now, if me fish weighed just the
same as Nick&rsquo;s, with some missing where thim
sassy big crabs had had a breakfast. Sure, I
want all I got, till we weigh the beauty. Afther
that they can have it all, for what I care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s where the shoe pinches, does
it?&rdquo; chuckled Jack. &ldquo;Well, perhaps you&rsquo;d
better sit up, and keep watch, Jimmy. But
please don&rsquo;t shake the boat so much, and wake
me again. It&rsquo;s only three o&rsquo;clock, with the
old moon near the eastern horizon. Me to bed
again for another snooze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When morning came Jimmy blandly informed
Jack that he had actually spent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
balance of the night with that pole in his
hands, every now and then stirring the water
in the vicinity of his prize.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I do be thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he added, triumphantly,
&ldquo;that the crabs niver got aven a
teenty bit of me bully ould fish. Now to rig
up that balance once more, and settle the question
once for all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, just you hold your horses, there,&rdquo;
spoke up Nick, shaking his head grimly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong, that&rsquo;s what. Even if your
old porpoise does happen to be a little heavier
than my splendid jewfish, don&rsquo;t you think for
a minute I&rsquo;m going to give up the ship. I&rsquo;ll
be warm on your trail, old chap, to the last
gasp!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; cried Josh, clapping his
hands in a manner which was calculated to
encourage both stubborn contestants. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
backing Nick for a game one. He&rsquo;s got the
real bulldog grit, and don&rsquo;t you forget it, boys!
And even if Jimmy wins this time, he&rsquo;ll have
to watch out, or he&rsquo;ll find himself left in the
lurch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rude balances were constructed as before,
and after getting the porpoise ashore, it
was duly weighed. Had it happened to be a
close thing, Nick of a certainty would have
entered a protest, and demanded that they tow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the prize to the next town, where it could be
tested on the dock with some capable scales.
But it was quickly discovered that the porpoise
was many pounds heavier than Nick&rsquo;s
record; indeed, they decided finally, after making
all due allowances, to put it down positively
at two hundred and seventy-five pounds.</p>

<p>Even Nick concurred in this, although with
a wry face, for he had clung tenaciously to
hope up to the very last moment. And so the
crabs had a chance to feast on the bulky object
after all; though Jack declared that if
they had had the time he would have liked to
try and render the porpoise for its oil, just to
say he had secured a supply that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And think of the numberless fine shoe laces
we&rsquo;re throwing away,&rdquo; sighed Josh, after
they had abandoned Jimmy&rsquo;s prize.</p>

<p>After a fine run they made Miami, and spent
a day in the enterprising little town; but all
of them were anxious to be getting on, since
they expected the next mail to be awaiting
them at Tampa; and it had been a long time
now since they had heard from the dear ones
at home.</p>

<p>Tampa was reached without any further
adventures, though Nick proved that his words
had been no idle boast when saying that if
Jimmy went up head in the little game of fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
rivalry, he would leave no stone unturned in
the effort to regain his lost laurels.</p>

<p>He never let a chance pass to put out one
or more lines. And since size was now his
one object in life, he no longer bothered with
a rod and line. If the fellows wanted fish
for eating purposes, somebody else must take
the trouble to capture them, because he was
too busy to bother with small fry.</p>

<p>So every night he would get out his shark
hook, and set it in the best place he could find,
where he believed he would have a chance to
make a capture.</p>

<p>The tables had turned, and it was now
Jimmy&rsquo;s turn to strut around with that look
of superiority on his face. He would watch
Nick&rsquo;s feverish labors, and just grin in a way
that gave the rest of the boys great amusement.</p>

<p>But, although several sharks were caught,
they seemed to be in league with Jimmy; for
it was only the small fellows who took the
hook. Nick&rsquo;s excitement, when he was working
his catch in by the aid of a snubbing post
which Jack showed him how to make, was
always succeeded by bitter disappointment,
after he had discovered the disgusting size of
the caught sea tiger.</p>

<p>Not one of them up to now had weighed
anything near the required weight. But all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the time the sanguine fat boy lived in hopes
of some fine day making a record strike.</p>

<p>The others hoped he would, seeing how
much his heart was set on proving himself
true game. This rivalry would prove to be a
great thing for Nick. It had started him into
doing things that otherwise he would never
have dreamed of attempting, being somewhat
given to laziness, as so many boys built after
his stout fashion seem to be. And it had made
him think, too, which was a fine thing; throwing
him on his own resources, as it were, and
bringing out many hidden attributes which
the others had never dreamed he possessed.</p>

<p>At Tampa Nick insisted that George keep
his word. So, as the three boats had been laid
up in the yard of a boat builder, a new motor
was installed aboard the <i>Wireless</i>. George
was so devoted to his boat and its speed record,
that he refused to be away from the scene
of operations for any length of time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day around Tampa is enough for me,
boys,&rdquo; he had declared, when they tried to
tempt him to accompany them on the second
day. &ldquo;I want to be around, and watch how
they do this job. It would give me a bad jolt,
you know, if I had to sacrifice speed for steadiness
after all, when I&rsquo;m hoping to combine
both.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; laughed Josh, &ldquo;it&rsquo;d sure break
George&rsquo;s heart if he couldn&rsquo;t just shoot
through the water like an arrow. If he had
his way he&rsquo;d go at about the rate of ninety
miles an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make it an even hundred, Josh, while
you&rsquo;re about it,&rdquo; George remarked, calmly;
and meant it, too.</p>

<p>A number of days were passed in the hustling
city on Tampa Bay. Jack had always
been anxious to see the place; and during the
time of their enforced stay they certainly took
in every point of interest worth observing.</p>

<p>And of course the <i>Comfort</i> was duly repaired
in a proper manner while the opportunity
offered. The boat builder complimented
Jack on having done such a reliable job under
such difficult conditions. He declared that the
chances were, the repairs would have held out
through the whole cruise, though it was best
that they have the hole obliterated in shipshape
style once for all.</p>

<p>But all of them were really glad when, one
fine morning, after another Norther had blown
itself out, and the big bay calmed down, the
little flotilla of three motor boats started away
from Tampa, headed south, so as to get around
the end of the Pinellas Peninsula.</p>

<p>Nick especially was sighing for new chances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to show what he could do in the fishing line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be sharks upwards of three
hundred pounds and more that will take my
hook,&rdquo; he declared, stoutly, to George, as they
boomed along down the bay; &ldquo;and in good
time I&rsquo;m going to show you something that
will make you sit up and take notice, see if I
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, she runs like oiled silk!&rdquo; exclaimed
the skipper of the new <i>Wireless</i>; and from
this remark Nick realized that, according to
George, all his affairs were as a mere dot compared
with the great question as to what the
new motor would do.</p>

<p>After trying the boat in various ways,
George expressed himself as satisfied that he
had made a good thing when he decided to
have the engine changed. And all the others
began to hope that the troubles of the speed
boat skipper might now be in the past.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay is so big that the motor boats
felt the swell almost as much as though they
were upon the gulf itself. And that afternoon,
when, after passing sharply to the right,
they placed Long Key between themselves and
the sea, all expressed themselves as pleased
at the change.</p>

<p>Here they made out to pass the night. Nick
could hardly wait until the anchors had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
dropped before he was begging Jack to go
off with the castnet, and get him a supply of
mullet for bait, so he could begin his fishing
operations. And as Jack was feeling that a
supper of mullet would taste rather good, if
so be the jumping fish proved to be plentiful,
he did not have to be coaxed long.</p>

<p>Consequently the shark line was soon doing
business at the old stand; and as usual there
arose a wordy war between the two rivals
concerning the finish of the game; each feeling
stoutly confident that in the end he would be
in a condition to carry off the prize.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a><br />
<small>THE SHARK FISHERMAN.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;How long have we got before we ought to
be home?&rdquo; asked Herb, that night, as they
prepared to camp ashore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly three weeks left of our time,&rdquo; remarked
Josh, sadly; for, much as they wanted
to see the dear ones, they would all be sorry
when the vacation had reached its end, and
once more they must take up school duties at
home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But looky here,&rdquo; piped up Nick, &ldquo;my dad
wrote me that they&rsquo;d had a bad hitch about
building the high school again. Seems like
there was a labor strike that tied up everything.
It ain&rsquo;t settled yet, he says, and if it
ain&rsquo;t done soon, why, the chances are there
won&rsquo;t be any session at all this Spring, because
they don&rsquo;t know just where to house us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glory be!&rdquo; cried Jimmy; &ldquo;oh! what an
illegant toime we could be afther having, down
in this cruiser&rsquo;s paradise, if so be thim laborin&rsquo;
men only hold the fort a little longer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He voiced the sentiment that filled every
heart, although no one else had spoken a word
as yet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be too good to be true,&rdquo; Jack
laughed, shaking his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we mustn&rsquo;t let the idea get hold
of us, because we&rsquo;d only be disappointed all
the more,&rdquo; Herb remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll know by the time we get to New
Orleans, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; demanded Nick, with set
jaws, and a flash to his blue eyes; &ldquo;because,
you see, I&rsquo;m interested more&rsquo;n the rest of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say ye so?&rdquo; burst out Jimmy, wickedly,
and chuckling under his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it would give me plenty of time
to burst bubbles that are floating around here,
and establish a new record,&rdquo; Nick went on,
pugnaciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, by the powers,&rdquo; Jimmy declared, &ldquo;I
do be hopin&rsquo; that we spind the whole bally
winter down here. It amuses me to see ye
worrk, Nick. An&rsquo;, by the same token, it&rsquo;s
doin&rsquo; ye a hape of good in the bargain, so it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had reached Cedar Keys, and everything
was going well. George still found
more or less reason to congratulate himself on
his wisdom in making that change in his motive
power. Now and then Jack saw him
pondering, and understood that there was a
fly in the ointment somewhere; but George had
said nothing, and they could only hazard a
guess as to whether it might be a diminution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of speed, or the old haunting fear of a breakdown
still gripping his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do we strike next for mail?&rdquo; asked
Herb, the night after leaving the city on the
key, when, after passing the mouth of the
famous Suwannee River, they had pulled up
back of a friendly key.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pensacola is our next port; and I hope we
find more letters waiting for us than there
were here,&rdquo; George replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s quare,&rdquo; remarked Jimmy,
with a twinkle in his eye; &ldquo;when ivery one
of us got a letter from the folks back home.
But I do be fearin&rsquo; the little girlie with the
rosy cheeks, and the dimple in her chin forgot
to write that toime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s that to anybody but me?&rdquo;
said George, facing them all boldly.</p>

<p>The conversation immediately switched to
another subject, for George was rather touchy
about having his private affairs talked about
by his chums. Had it been Nick, now, or even
Jimmy, they would have answered back in the
same humor, and the fun waxed fast and
furious.</p>

<p>But at the time Nick was busy with that
shark line of his. He fancied that as the tide
came in and went out through what might be
called an inlet, always with more or less confusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
there was a pretty good chance to hook
one of the sea tigers, if only he took pains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve changed our course again, haven&rsquo;t
we, Jack?&rdquo; Herb asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; came the reply; &ldquo;you see, the
coast no longer runs nearly north and south
here, but turns to the west. And if one of
those old Northers bursts on us now, why,
we&rsquo;ll get it from land side instead of the gulf;
unless it whirls around, something these winter
blows seldom do; because, you see, they
don&rsquo;t happen to be of the tornado, or hurricane
type, just straight wind storms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack was always a fund of information to
his mates. He studied things at every opportunity,
and never forgot a fact he had learned.
And it was surprising how the others had
come by degrees to depend on him in all sorts
of emergencies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do be glad, Jack, darlint,&rdquo; remarked
Jimmy, just then, &ldquo;that ye make Nick put on
a loife preserver ivery toime he do be going
in that cranky dinky, to carry out his baited
shark hook. It&rsquo;s him that is so clumsy, the
boat looks like &rsquo;twould turrn over at any minute,
so it does. And he so fat and juicy, how
do we know some hungry shark mightn&rsquo;t loike
to take a bite out of him? Look now at the
gossoon, would ye, and how he worrks? In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
all me experience I niver yit saw such a change
as there has been in our Nick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; laughed Herb. &ldquo;You
know, they say competition is the life of trade;
and it seems to be putting a good lot of life
in Nick Longfellow. Why, he jumps around
now like nobody ever saw him do before. If
this keeps up long, he&rsquo;ll be able to play on our
baseball team next season. Wow! just imagine
the Ice Wagon galloping across centre to
grab a long fly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the object of all this talk was
paying strict attention to business. He had
been shark fishing so many times now that he
seemed to have the whole thing down to a fine
science. After baiting his bog hook, with its
attendant chain, he dropped it in a promising
place. Then he made for the shore, paying
out the stout line as he went most carefully.</p>

<p>Once on the sandy strip of beach, Nick fastened
the rope to the nearest tree he could find,
first taking a couple of hitches around a stake
he had driven in deeply, not far from the
water&rsquo;s edge, and which was to serve as a snubbing
post, in case he were lucky enough to
make a strike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very pat,&rdquo; remarked Jack, when the
stout youth rejoined the group about the fire,
&ldquo;that if any of us want to know about sharks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
their habits, and how best to get the pirates
of the sea ashore, we&rsquo;ve got to go to Nick
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; spoke up George, &ldquo;he ought to be
a walking dictionary of terms; because he&rsquo;s
always asking questions of every cracker and
sponger we meet. I honestly believe, boys,
he keeps a shark book, and that he&rsquo;s got an
idea of writing the family tree up some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! come off,&rdquo; grinned Nick; &ldquo;after I&rsquo;ve
hauled a dandy weighing about half a ton on
shore, and showed you what I can do, I guess
the whole business can go hang, for all of me.
What use are they, anyhow? You can&rsquo;t eat
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way Nick always judges
things,&rdquo; declared George. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t
happen to be good for food, he&rsquo;s got mighty
little use for the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t denying it, am I?&rdquo; queried the
other, good-naturedly. &ldquo;What are we here
for, anyway, but to eat our way through this
dreary old world? Of course, don&rsquo;t go and
think I believe eating&rsquo;s the <i>only</i> thing worth
living for; but it cuts a big figure with me.
Guess I was born half starved, and I&rsquo;ve been
tryin&rsquo; all I knew how ever since to make it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And by the powers, ye look that happy
now, I be afther thinkin&rsquo; ye must expect to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
pull in the champion fish this same night,&rdquo;
Jimmy commented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got a hunch that something is
about due,&rdquo; Nick replied, confidently.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fishy smell about this place, seems
to me; and I just reckon that in times past
many a dandy old shark has been yanked up
on this same beach. That tideway looked good
to me, too; and by now, as Jack said, I ought
to know something about the hungry crew.
Just wait and see what happens, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jimmy became a little uneasy. Perhaps it
was in the air that his day to fall had come
around in due time. He cast frequent glances
over toward the snubbing post as the evening
drew on, with twilight succeeding the setting
of the sun.</p>

<p>Nick had heard Jack telling how he went
pickerel fishing on the ice one winter, and the
methods of telling when a fish took the hook
appealed to him. Consequently he employed
the same sort of tactics when in pursuit of
nobler game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For, you see, they call a pickerel or a pike
a fresh-water shark,&rdquo; he had explained, when
first testing the plan; &ldquo;and what is good for
one, ought to work with the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the top of the snubbing post he had fastened
an iron ring. The rope passed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
this, being secured by a staple that could be
easily dislodged, as it was intended for only
temporary use.</p>

<p>Back of the post the line was coiled up several
times, and a white rag fastened to it at
a certain point. When a shark carried off
the baited hook, this slack would quickly pass
through the ring at the top of the stout post,
so that the flag must mount upward, and signal
to the alert fisherman that he had made
a strike; when he could hasten to attend to
his captive.</p>

<p>They were eating supper, as the night closed
in. Nick had seated himself in a comfortable
position, where he might occasionally raise his
eyes, and by a turn of the head look off in
the direction where his trap was laid.</p>

<p>During the earlier part of the meal he had
paid strict attention to business, and glanced
that way about once a minute faithfully. But
as the spirit of feasting took a firmer clutch
upon his soul, the fat boy began to forget.</p>

<p>Not so Jimmy. He had taken up his quarters
so that he might observe the goings on at
the snubbing post without even turning his
head. And as he munched away at what he
had on his tin platter, the Irish lad kept a
close watch for the flaunting of the tell-tale
signal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack saw this, and he knew that all he had
to do in order to keep fully posted as to the
way things were working, was to watch Jimmy,
whose freckled face would serve as a thermometer.</p>

<p>And after a while, when it was almost pitch-dark
around the camp on the edge of the water,
he discovered that Jimmy was staring at the
snubbing post as though fascinated. His lips
were working, too, though apparently he was
having a hard time trying to speak, and tell
his rival that the trap was working.</p>

<p>But Jimmy was clean-cut and generous,
even to one with whom he had entered into
a contest for supremacy; and presently he
burst forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would ye be afther getting a move on,
Nick?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the flag a
flutterin&rsquo; on the top of the post like a signal
man wigwaggin&rsquo; in the Boy Scouts troop!
And by the powers, it&rsquo;s gone now, pulled clane
out of the socket. Be off with ye; for, by the
same token, ye&rsquo;ve cotched the granddaddy of
all the sharrks, I do belave!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a><br />
<small>VICTORY COMES TO NICK.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Whoop! here I go, fellers!&rdquo; shouted Nick,
as, scrambling awkwardly to his feet, he hurried
along the beach toward the spot where he
had left his shark line.</p>

<p>Of course the rest hastened to follow after
him. They found the fat boy bending down
and feeling of the taut rope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee whittaker! but I&rsquo;ve caught the biggest
ever, I do believe!&rdquo; Nick was crying. &ldquo;Just
feel that line, would you? Acts like it had
hold of a house, with the tide running out.
Say, it&rsquo;ll take me all night to get that monster
ashore; but I&rsquo;ll do it; you hear me warble,
Jimmy, I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Nick!&rdquo; laughed Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll back you up to win out, if you only
keep everlastingly at it,&rdquo; remarked Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t be afther forgettin&rsquo; the rules
of the game, all of ye,&rdquo; warned Jimmy. &ldquo;Nobody
must put a finger on the loine to hilp
Nick. I want to see him have fair play, so I
do. And, by the same token, if he bates me
by three hundred pounds, I&rsquo;ll be the firrst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
gossoon to congratulate him on his success.
You know that, boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure we do, Jimmy,&rdquo; spoke up George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be like you not to do the same,&rdquo;
declared Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know what you&rsquo;ve just got to do,
Nick,&rdquo; remarked Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess I do,&rdquo; chuckled the owner of the outfit,
as he looked eagerly out over the darkening
water to that point toward which the taut line
seemed to extend; but if he entertained a faint
hope that the prisoner would leap into view
while trying to get rid of the steel barb, he
mistook the nature of the shark, which bores
deep, and tries to do by main strength what
a tarpon, a trout, a salmon or a black bass
attempts by that upward fling, and shake of
the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going it pretty furious right now,&rdquo;
Josh observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the harder he pulls the better,&rdquo;
Nick said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll help to tire the old chap
out, and make it easier for poor me to get him
ashore, foot by foot, by making use of my
snubbing post here. But let&rsquo;s go back and
finish our supper, boys. If the hook holds,
and the rope is as good as I think, he&rsquo;ll be
here tugging away an hour from now, just as
much as he is now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where your head&rsquo;s level, Nick,&rdquo;
commented Jack.</p>

<p>And so the whole party wended their way
back to where the camp-fire blazed on the
shore. Here the pleasant task of finishing
their meal was once more resumed. Some of
them thought Nick was really devouring even
more than usual, though that might be hard
to believe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wants to get his strength up to top-notch!&rdquo;
laughed Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; observed Nick, calmly, as he
reached deliberately over, and took the last
helping of Boston baked beans from the tin
kettle in which they had been heated for the
meal; &ldquo;I hate to see things go to waste; and
there are some fellers around who don&rsquo;t seem
to know what&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed,&rdquo; Josh remarked, drily, &ldquo;that
you don&rsquo;t mind how much goes to <i>your</i> waist,
all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick only groaned at the pun, and went on
cleaning out his platter, as though he believed
in always laying in a healthy supply of food,
since nobody could tell when another chance
might come around.</p>

<p>Afterwards they lay about the camp and
told stories, joked and even sang school songs.
Nick seemed in no great hurry to take up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
task that awaited him. He knew from former
experiences just what it meant. But that the
subject was on his mind all the while was made
manifest from what he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack, I want to ask you a question!&rdquo; he
began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, fire away, then,&rdquo; suggested the other,
with a nod of invitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If, now, this fellow at the end of my line
turns out to be so heavy that I just can&rsquo;t budge
him, when I get the chump at the edge of the
water, would it be breaking the rules if I
borrowed that block and tackle to help yank
him out, so you can all see him, and estimate
his weight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about that, fellows?&rdquo; asked Jack,
looking around with a wink toward the other
chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course he can make use of any
means, so long as no other person lends a hand
to assist him,&rdquo; George gave as his opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; Josh added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he goes and gets the falls and fixes the
whole blooming business himself, of course
he&rsquo;s got the right to do it,&rdquo; declared Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I do be saying that it&rsquo;s a clever
schame, that does Nick credit,&rdquo; was the verdict
of Jimmy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That settles it, then, Nick,&rdquo; Jack decided.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unanimous, you hear; and if you want,
you can go and get the block and tackle
arranged right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! do you think, then, I&rsquo;ll surely need
it, Jack?&rdquo; asked the fat boy, trembling with
joyous anticipations; for from the tenor of
Jack&rsquo;s words he expected that they all believed
he had caught the biggest of sharks, one that
would make that little porpoise of Jimmy&rsquo;s
look like a baby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you did,&rdquo; Jack
replied, with a reassuring nod.</p>

<p>Accordingly, after he had cleaned off his
pannikin, and not a second sooner, Nick
hunted up the rope and blocks with which they
had hauled the <i>Comfort</i> out on skids at the
time of her accident.</p>

<p>By a skillful use of such an apparatus, one
man&rsquo;s strength is made equal to that of several;
and the boys had learned this fact
through actual experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us know when you expect to get busy,&rdquo;
called out Herb, as Nick went off with the falls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, because we want to enjoy it all, you
know, Nick,&rdquo; sang out George.</p>

<p>Perhaps half an hour passed, with the fat
boy busily engaged getting his apparatus
ready. Then they heard him give a call.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi! hello, there! fellers; suppose somebody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
starts a fire agoing for me here; that&rsquo;s allowable,
ain&rsquo;t it, Jack?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, since it hasn&rsquo;t anything to
do with getting the shark ashore,&rdquo; the one
addressed responded, as all of them jumped
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to begin yanking him in now;
but it&rsquo;s so pesky gloomy I ain&rsquo;t able to see
just right,&rdquo; Nick continued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be a shame
now if I lost this dandy chap just because I
didn&rsquo;t see how to work him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of the boys gathered dead leaf stalks
from under a nearby palmetto, and in next to
no time they had a fine, ruddy blaze crackling
close by the spot where Nick was standing, his
shirt sleeves rolled up, and an air of grim
determination about his whole person.</p>

<p>The first thing he did was to make sure the
rope went twice around the snubbing post, so
that he might always have a hitch. Then he
fastened the end of the rope belonging to the
falls to the strained fish line, a dozen feet beyond
the snubbing post.</p>

<p>His operations were watched with considerable
interest by his mates, who realized that
quite a transformation was rapidly taking
place in the character of the once placid and
indolent fat boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here goes, then!&rdquo; exclaimed Nick, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
threw his full weight on the rope that went
through the several blocks.</p>

<p>They could hear him grunting at a great
rate, which indicated what an effort it was
to get the shark started shoreward against his
will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bully! he&rsquo;s beginning to make it!&rdquo;
whooped George, greatly excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Nick!&rdquo; shouted Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walk away with it, me bhoy!&rdquo; cried
Jimmy, as though quite forgetting that success
for Nick meant defeat for him.</p>

<p>The stout fisherman was indeed doing just
what Jimmy advised, and walking away with
things. When he had gone as far as he could,
he managed to whip the rope around some
object. Then, returning to the now slack fishing
line, above the spot where he had fastened
the falls, he drew it taut around the snubbing
post.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He gained at least ten feet that time,&rdquo; declared
Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, oh! my! ain&rsquo;t the old terror mad,
though?&rdquo; exclaimed George. &ldquo;Just see how
he pulls, would you, boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give him another turn, Nick,&rdquo; advised
Jack.</p>

<p>Unfastening the falls, Nick took the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
hitch, and as before this was some distance
below the snubbing post.</p>

<p>Again he bent his stout back, and, aided by
the tackle, he succeeded in bringing the struggling
sea monster closer in to the shore.</p>

<p>Everything was working smoothly, and by
the time he had repeated his effort a good
many times they could see from the terrific
splashing that the prisoner was already in
shoal water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m going to get him?&rdquo;
gasped poor, winded Nick, as he wiped his
streaming forehead, and tried to get ready for
the hardest tug of all; for, with a dead weight
on the sand to haul, he could no longer count
on the buoyancy of the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I should smile, yes,&rdquo; declared
George. &ldquo;At him again, Ginger; never say
die! Set &rsquo;em up in the other alley! This is
a great treat to us, Nick, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Nick was already busy. With the rope
over his shoulder, and his toes digging in the
sand, he tugged away like a good fellow, gaining
inch by inch. This time he succeeded in
dragging the shark all the way out of the
water, so that it lay exposed to their view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurroo! he done it!&rdquo; shouted Jimmy, with
an utter disregard for the rules of grammar,
that would have horrified his teachers, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
any of them heard him; but Jimmy had one
set of rules to mark his vacation manners, and
another covering his connection with the seats
of learning; and when he wished could talk
just as correctly as the next one.</p>

<p>They gathered around, full of wonder at
the size and ferocity of the monster, that even
then lay there on the sand, snapping savagely
at everything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it beat Jimmy&rsquo;s porpoise?&rdquo; asked
Nick, proudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half again as heavy!&rdquo; declared Jack; &ldquo;for
I reckon it must weigh all of four hundred
pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a><br />
<small>WHERE AMBITION LED.</small></h2>


<p>True to his word, the generous Irish lad
was the very first to grasp Nick&rsquo;s blistered
hand and congratulate him on his wonderful
success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what comes of stick-at-it-tiveness,&rdquo;
declared Herb, ponderously, as he, too, gripped
the fingers of the successful shark fisherman.</p>

<p>Nick was allowed to get the rifle, and wind
up the career of the savage sea monster. In
the morning they estimated his weight, just
as they had done with others in the past.
Everybody was satisfied to agree with that
first guess which Jack made, and call it four
hundred. And they declared that Nick was
a wonder, in that with only the assistance of
the falls, he had dragged such a monster up
on the beach.</p>

<p>The voyage was resumed that day, and for
the better part of a week they were put to it
dodging storms, making outside runs when the
fair weather allowed of their braving the open
gulf, and extricating themselves from various
unpleasant predicaments, when they managed
to lose themselves in what had promised to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
be a convenient cut-off, but which proved a
trap in the shape of shallow water, with many
chances of the boats sticking in the mud.</p>

<p>After Pensacola would come Mobile; and
then the next place they expected to reach
would be their destination, New Orleans.</p>

<p>Each night as they figured on the time that
still remained, a sense of gloom would descend
upon the camp, though Jack or else Jimmy
soon dissipated it by some joking remark, or
it might be by bursting out into ragtime song.
But they had had such a glorious time since
starting out on this remarkable voyage that
they viewed its approaching finish with a
feeling bordering on dismay.</p>

<p>Jimmy had now taken to being haunted by
a desire to eclipse the great feat of his stout
rival. Though it did not seem that there might
be one chance in fifty of his succeeding in
capturing a fish that would exceed the weight
of that monster shark, Jimmy had developed
an industrious trait.</p>

<p>Early and late his mind was set upon the
game. Nick had generously turned over his
shark tackle to the other. He guaranteed that
it was sound, and capable of sustaining any
strain.</p>

<p>So Jimmy would each night do just what
the other had been engaged in until recently;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and the way he attended to that line was
worthy of all praise.</p>

<p>But, although hardly a night went by that
he did not make some sort of capture, his best
effort fell far short of the necessary heft, and
Nick began to feel that the wager was as good
as won. Nevertheless, he watched all that
Jimmy did with a certain amount of interest,
not to say anxiety, knowing that there is, according
to the old saying, &ldquo;many a slip
between the cup and the lip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All of them were in the very best of health,
and in this the voyage down the coast, and
around the end of Florida among the keys had
done them good. Even Josh seemed to have
recovered from his spell of indigestion, and
was able to do his share of the eating.</p>

<p>How could it be otherwise, when they were
living in the open air day and night, drinking
in the pure ozone all the while; with contented
minds, and plenty to appease the
healthy demands of the inner man?</p>

<p>So one fine afternoon they headed up the
wide bay leading to Pensacola, expecting to
get more home letters here. George had a
wrinkle between his eyes at times, but this
was not on account of any anxiety in connection
with a girl he had left behind him, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
some of the others jokingly declared. The fact
was, his new engine was giving him a little
trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell you what, George,&rdquo; Herb had said,
when they had to stop an hour for the other
to do some work, in order to induce the motor
to carry on its part; &ldquo;your old <i>Wireless</i> is
just a hoodoo, and that&rsquo;s what ails you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted George, in disgust, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
beginning to believe that way myself, to be
honest now. I&rsquo;ve done everything a fellow
could do, even to installing a new and guaranteed
motor; yet here the measly thing goes
back on me, just like the old one used to. Huh!
it&rsquo;s just sickening, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you see, George,&rdquo; Josh remarked, with
a wide grin, &ldquo;the bally boat wouldn&rsquo;t feel right
at all if it went too smooth. Ever since you
first got her she&rsquo;s been accustomed to playing
you tricks. Expect her to reform all at once,
and be as meek as Moses? Well, I guess not.
Give her time, George, plenty of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! she&rsquo;s got to see me through this
cruise,&rdquo; declared the owner of the cranky
speed boat; &ldquo;because I haven&rsquo;t got the money
to buy another right now. And no matter
what the rest of you say, I&rsquo;ve somehow always
loved this boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; observed Herb; &ldquo;they always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
say that the bad child is loved most by its parents,
because they feel the greatest anxiety
for that one. But give me the steady old
<i>Comfort</i>, that never keeps me awake guessing
what sort of trick it&rsquo;ll play next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; remarked George,
indifferently; &ldquo;everybody to their taste. But
I&rsquo;d die in that tub, watching all the rest run
circles around me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! hardly that,&rdquo; laughed Herb; &ldquo;because,
you see, once in a while there&rsquo;s a little ripple
of excitement comes breezing along, when
some fellow asks to be taken in tow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, after that George had nothing
further to say; for he could look back to several
instances that were full of humiliation to
his proud spirit, when necessity had forced
him to accept of this friendly aid on the part
of his chums.</p>

<p>But they reached Pensacola finally in good
shape. George hoped that after all, as the
others said, that one little trick on the part
of his engine might have only been a slip that
would never occur again; though his confidence
was shaken, and he watched its working
suspiciously after that.</p>

<p>Letters from home greeted them at Pensacola;
but no new developments were contained
in them, at least nothing positive. The strike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
had not been settled, and there was warm talk
of the town putting men to work regardless
of labor unions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so little has been done,&rdquo; Jack remarked,
after getting the consensus of opinions
from all the letters that had been read,
&ldquo;that I can&rsquo;t see, for the life of me, how
they&rsquo;re ever going to complete the building
this season. I understand that it was proposed
to use the biggest church in a pinch; but just
as luck would have it, the heating plant in
that has gone all to pieces, so that the scholars
would be apt to freeze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other, and smiled.
Perhaps they were, deep down in their hearts,
secretly hoping that the workers up there
would keep on quarreling, and the completion
of the high school building be postponed until
the next summer. For boys give little thought
concerning lost opportunities in the way of
learning. Besides, were they not getting the
finest lessons possible in the line of self reliance;
and was not this long cruise the best
sort of education, when they had learned a
thousand things that could never be forgotten?</p>

<p>When they left Pensacola the weather appeared
favorable; but at this season of the
year nothing can be taken for granted; so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the experienced cruiser is accustomed to keeping
a strict watch for signs of storms.</p>

<p>They had need of caution about this time,
since there arose a necessity for considerable
outside work, always dangerous in small boats,
because of shallow water near the shore, and
an absence of suitable harbors in which to seek
shelter, should a sudden gale arise.</p>

<p>If all went well, they anticipated making
it a one-night stop between Pensacola and
Mobile; and Jack thought he had the place
for this camp picked out on his coast chart,
which he studied faithfully.</p>

<p>So, as this day moved along, they were putting
the miles behind them at a steady rate.
George had no new trouble with his engine,
though it was noticed that he cut out some of
his racing ahead of the others. Constant
friction from water will wear away granite in
time; and the numerous and long-continued
troubles of George must be making an impression
on his usually buoyant spirits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alabama, here we rest!&rdquo; sang out Jack,
about five in the afternoon, as he pointed
ahead to where a friendly island or key
offered them the shelter they craved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; Nick was heard to say,
and they could easily guess why; for of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Nick must be ravenously hungry&mdash;he nearly
always was.</p>

<p>Accordingly they headed in, meaning to pass
behind the end of the key that jutted out like
a human finger, offering an asylum to all small
craft that could gain the sheltered water
behind.</p>

<p>It was just while they were slowing up, since
caution had to be exercised whenever they
neared shoal waters, that Herb called out
excitedly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Jack, look out yonder; what in the
dickens is that coming along, and sticking out
of the water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course every eye was instantly turned
in the direction Herb was pointing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a whale!&rdquo; shouted Nick, almost falling
overboard in his excitement, as he discovered
some dreadful looking black object rushing
through the water amid a sparkling mass of
foam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A whale!&rdquo; echoed Jimmy, dancing up and
down excitedly; &ldquo;Och! if I only had a harpoon
now, wouldn&rsquo;t it be just grand? A whale
would knock the spots out of the biggest shark
that iver grew, so it would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack had snatched up his marine glasses,
and was leveling them at the monster, back
of which trailed that line of foam and bubbles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
The others, watching, saw him stare as
though hardly able to believe his eyes, and
then laugh outright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! there goes Jimmy in the dinky; and,
would you believe it, he&rsquo;s got a gun!&rdquo; exclaimed
Nick. &ldquo;Nothing is too big to scare
that boy, I do believe. He&rsquo;d just as soon
tackle a whale as a sunfish. Call him back,
Jack, or he&rsquo;ll be drowned!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack laid down the glasses, which had occupied
his attention so much that he had not
observed the actions of his cruising mate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, you, Jimmy, come right back!&rdquo; he
called, though he could hardly talk because
of the desire to laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But howld on, Jack, darlint, didn&rsquo;t ye be
afther sayin&rsquo; anything that swum was a fish;
and if I get a whale ain&rsquo;t it fair play?&rdquo; the
other replied, pausing in his labor of using the
short oars belonging to the <i>Tramp&rsquo;s</i> tender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, I did,&rdquo; answered Jack; &ldquo;but that
didn&rsquo;t mean you could go around banging away
at one of your Uncle Sam&rsquo;s submarines, out
for a trial spin from the Pensacola navy-yard.
I guess you&rsquo;d better come back now, before
you get in trouble; don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a><br />
<small>WINDING UP THE VOYAGE&mdash;CONCLUSION.</small></h2>


<p>Ambitious Jimmy evidently came to the
conclusion that a Government submarine was
rather larger game than he cared to tackle.
Besides, from the riotous way in which his
five chums were laughing, he must have become
convinced that there would be sustained
objections to allowing him to count his prize,
even did he bag such prey.</p>

<p>At any rate, he ceased rowing, and backed
water, returning to the <i>Tramp</i>, with one of
his characteristic wide grins decorating his
freckled face. So the others never knew
whether the wild Irish lad might have been
playing a joke upon them, or really thought
it was a whale, which he might as well try
to take in.</p>

<p>The submarine had by this time vanished
from sight, evidently testing her ability to remain
under the surface of the water for a
length of time; as well as proceeding at a
rapid clip when partly submerged. But the
boys did not see anything of the strange craft
again.</p>

<p>They made their camp that night, just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Jack had figured upon doing. And on the following
day, by cleverly getting an early start,
they passed around grim Fort Morgan, sailing
up Mobile Bay, where gallant Farragut
earned his lasting laurels many years ago.</p>

<p>But, besides securing their letters, if there
were any, they did not mean to remain long
here. One day sufficed to show them all they
cared to see of the quaint little city that has
had such a history.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, all the boys were anxious as
to what news might await them when they
reached New Orleans. That, of course, was
to be the deciding point. If nothing new developed,
it was of course their intention to
hold to their original plan. This had been to
ship the three motor boats up the Mississippi
by some packet, themselves taking passage on
a train, headed for home.</p>

<p>As they had previously made a voyage down
the Father of Waters; and heading up against
the fierce current was never to be thought of
on the part of such small craft, this was really
the only thing they could do.</p>

<p>Apparently they had plenty of time to reach
their destination on schedule, and yet none
knew better than did Jack Stormways how
exasperating delays often occur to hold motor
boats up. There was George, for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
with his unlucky speed boat, which might become
disabled at a time when they would lose
days towing him along; or it might be storms
would follow each other so fast that a necessary
outside passage could not be attempted.</p>

<p>And so they decided, that first night out
from Mobile, that if there was any loafing to
be done, they had better defer it until within
a single day&rsquo;s run of the Crescent City. When
their minds were perfectly free, and they knew
nothing was apt to interfere with their carefully
laid plans, that would be the time to
hang around, and rest up.</p>

<p>So day succeeded day, and they drew gradually
closer to their destination. Jimmy began
to look very doleful, or at least pretended to
be in the &ldquo;dumps,&rdquo; as Josh called it. The
wager would come to an end when they made
the city on the lower Mississippi, no matter
what their future course was to be. And if
he had not beaten that wonderful shark record
by then, the game was up.</p>

<p>Nick puffed himself out, and assumed airs.
He felt that he had really done himself proud
in bringing such a remarkable fish to land,
alone and unaided. He even made out solemnly
worded vouchers, which every one of
the others was compelled to sign; and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
in so many sentences told the actual story of
his feat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Nick explained, &ldquo;a lot of people
up in our town would call it just a fish story,
and let it go at that. And I want to prove it
to my dad as well. He never dreams what a
wonderful boy he&rsquo;s got. Guess they won&rsquo;t
laugh so much after this, because I happen
to have a little extra flesh on my bones. That
don&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m lacking in muscle, does it?
I think not. Haven&rsquo;t we got a shining example
of the same in our great and noble President
today? Huh! a fellow can be stout, and yet
some punkins, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that little kodak picture I took will
go a good way toward proving your story,
Nick,&rdquo; remarked Josh. &ldquo;When they see you
standing so nobly, with one foot on that <i>tre</i>menjous
shark, it&rsquo;d have to be a mighty suspicious
feller that would doubt your word. And
even Jimmy, here, your worsted competitor,
has signed your affidavy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure if I&rsquo;m worsted, I&rsquo;m wool, and a yarrd
wide!&rdquo; grinned the said Jimmy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, I notice that Jimmy doesn&rsquo;t
get busy any longer with that shark line,&rdquo; remarked
Herb, turning to the Irish lad with
a questioning look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he must have given it up as a bad
job,&rdquo; said George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about that, Jimmy; are you ready
to crown Nick as the king pin of the bunch
when it comes to bagging big fish? Shall we
get the laurel wreath, and put it on his brow?
Will you admit that you&rsquo;re cleanly beaten at
the game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack put the question direct, for he privately
knew that Jimmy had yielded the palm. The
other jumped up, snatched his banjo from the
ground, and began to strum something that
set the boys in a roar, and made Nick blush
with pleasure. For the tune was, &ldquo;Lo, the
Conquering Hero Comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have we been in making this
splendid run from Philadelphia?&rdquo; Herb
asked a little later, as Jack was jotting down
some notes of the day&rsquo;s run in his logbook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly three months, all told, counting our
numerous stops,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;or it will
be that when we get to New Orleans. December
is nearly over now; Christmas has gone
by, and the New Year only a few days away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t kept exact track, to tell the
truth,&rdquo; Herb went on; &ldquo;but I guessed it must
be about that. Do you want to know how?
Why, you remember that on our very first
night out, the moon was just four days old?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; spoke up George; &ldquo;for I
can recollect noticing it up in the western
heavens, and wishing it would hurry along, so
as to give us more light nights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is about the dark of the moon
now,&rdquo; added Herb, triumphantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use for Herb to ever own a watch
again,&rdquo; laughed Josh. &ldquo;He just prides himself
on being able to tell the time of day by
the sun; and now he&rsquo;s shown us how he can
find out what day of the month it is by the
moon. Pretty soon he&rsquo;ll be using the stars to
tell his age, and when he cut his first tooth.
Once you start in along that line, there&rsquo;s just
no limit to what you can do, I reckon, eh,
Herb?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all I can say, fellows,&rdquo; quoth Jack,
as he slapped his logbook shut, and glanced
around at the sunburned and healthy looking
faces of his five good camp-mates, &ldquo;is that
we&rsquo;ve surely had the time of our lives on this
dandy voyage; and no matter what happens
next, we&rsquo;re never going to forget the glorious
runs our little fleet of motor boats have made
outside, and in, along the whole coast, from
the frozen North to the Sunny South!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; shouted Josh, enthusiastically
waving his hat above his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never spoke truer words, Jack,&rdquo; remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
George, with deep feeling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure
been the happiest time of my whole life; or
would have been,&rdquo; he hastily added, while a
slight frown broke over his face, &ldquo;only for
the trouble that blessed old motor gave me
every little while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re all right now, George, with the
new engine aboard,&rdquo; condoled Nick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am,&rdquo; replied the skeptical
George; &ldquo;but the proof of the pudding is in
the eating of it. The new machine may go
back on me yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my goodness! you&rsquo;ve had it, going on
three weeks, and in all that time she only shied
once! What better do you want than that?&rdquo;
demanded Herb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, you never can tell,&rdquo; replied the
skipper of the <i>Wireless</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fact is, fellers,&rdquo; Nick declared, &ldquo;George
has become so used to looking for sudden
trouble to spring on him, that he can&rsquo;t think
of anything else. He&rsquo;s all the time watching
for a breakdown to happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three weeks ought to satisfy him that his
new engine is all to the good,&rdquo; remarked Josh,
&ldquo;but seems like it don&rsquo;t. Say, George makes
me think of that Irishman who was always
looking for trouble. He had been employed
by the same railroad company forty-three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
years; but, getting too old for the work, he was
let go. When some of his friends, seeing him
look so doleful, took him to task, he shook his
head and said, says he: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not surprised at
all I am; for ever since I began work here I&rsquo;ve
known it wouldn&rsquo;t be a permanent job!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so they laughed and joked as the time
slipped away.</p>

<p>Of course they did not intend passing
around to the delta of the mighty Mississippi,
when there was a much more convenient way
of reaching the Crescent City by passing
through the straits called the Rigolets, and
thus entering Lake Ponchartrain; from
whence, by means of the canal, the city could
be gained.</p>

<p>It was on New Year&rsquo;s day, at about three
in the afternoon, with a piping cold wind
streaming down from the frozen North, that
the little motor boat flotilla came to a last stop
in a quiet boatyard near the great city on the
river, which had seen the windup of a previous
voyage of the club.</p>

<p>And, anxious as they were to hear from
home, the six chums did not neglect to shake
hands all around over the remarkably successful
termination of their long and adventurous
trip down the Eastern coast, and among the
keys of Florida.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>If the news they received was what they expected
it would be, they intended to load the
three boats on the first packet bound up the
river, and then wend their way home by train.</p>

<p>Whether this plan was fated to be carried
out or not, must be left to another book.
Having attained the goal for which they had
striven so splendidly; and with the bitter
rivalry between Jimmy and Nick settled for
all time, we can safely leave our young friends
at this point, wishing them all good luck in
other voyages which they may undertake in
the near future.</p>

<p class="noi fighang">ne of the essential requirements of the Boy
Scout training is a <b>Knowledge of Woodcraft</b>.
This necessitates a book embracing
all the subjects and treating on all the topics that
a thorough knowledge of <b>Woodcraft</b> implies.</p>

<p>This book thoroughly exhausts the subject. It imparts
a comprehensive knowledge of woods from fungus
growth to the most stately monarch of the forest;
it treats of the habits and lairs of all the feathered and
furry inhabitants of the woods. Shows how to trail
wild animals; how to identify birds and beasts by
their tracks, calls, etc. Tells how to forecast the
weather, and in fact treats on every phase of nature
with which a Boy Scout or any woodman or lover of
nature should be familiar. The authorship guarantees
its authenticity and reliability. Indispensable to &ldquo;Boy
Scouts&rdquo; and others. Printed from large clear type on
superior paper.</p>
